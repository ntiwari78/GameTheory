# Game Theory Fundamentals: Study Guide

**Rationality, Common Knowledge, and Game Definitions**

---

## I. Two Fundamental Assumptions of Game Theory

### 1. **Rationality**

* **Definition**: Rationality, in the context of game theory, is the idea that individuals **optimize**. This could be minimizing costs, maximizing utility, or choosing optimal strategies given market conditions.
* **Common Misconception**: People often equate rationality with being emotionless. The lecturer argues that emotions can be rational—what matters is whether decisions optimize outcomes.
* **Practical Examples**:

  * A firm setting prices to maximize profit.
  * An individual deciding how much money to save.

#### Are Humans Rational?

* The question of whether humans are rational is central to the field of [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics).
* Behavioral economics identifies **systematic deviations** from rationality and has led to multiple [Nobel Prizes](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/).
* Despite imperfections, **rationality serves as a useful benchmark** for modeling and understanding behavior.

---

### 2. **Common Knowledge**

* **Definition**: Common knowledge goes beyond knowing a fact; it includes knowing that others know it, and knowing that others know that others know it—recursively.
* **Illustrative Example**: In the green-eyed prisoner problem, all prisoners know that others have green eyes. But only when this becomes *common knowledge* do they act.

> Knowing ≠ Common Knowledge

* **Formalization**:

  * "I am rational."
  * "I know that you are rational."
  * "You know that I know that you are rational."
  * ...and so on ad infinitum.

---

## II. What Is a Game?

### Elements of a Game:

1. **Players**: A finite or countable number (1, 2, 3... *n*).
2. **Strategies**: Each player has a defined set of possible actions.
3. **Objectives**: Each player is trying to **optimize** their outcome, taking into account what others are doing.

### Distinction from General Optimization:

* Not all optimization problems are games.
* **Non-Game Example**: Choosing between chocolate and vanilla ice cream at a fixed price is optimization, but **not a game**—no other player's actions affect your payoff.
* **Game Example**: Your payoff depends on both **your strategy and others' strategies**.

---

## III. Key Concepts and Terms

* **Rationality**: Optimizing behavior, not necessarily devoid of emotion.
* **Common Knowledge**: Mutually recognized and recursively known information among players.
* **Game**: A strategic interaction where each participant's outcome depends on others' actions.
* **Strategy**: A complete plan of action for every possible situation in a game.

---

## IV. Recommended Pre-Viewing

* **Video Prerequisite**: *The Mad Dictator and the Green-Eyed Prisoners*
  This illustrates the **difference between knowing and common knowledge** and is foundational for understanding the example in this lecture.


# Game Theory Examples: Simultaneous Move Games

---

## I. Overview

This section expands on the foundational ideas of **[game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)** by introducing **simultaneous move games**—games where all players choose their actions at the same time without knowing others' choices.

> In future sections, the discussion will extend to **sequential move games**, **games under uncertainty**, and more.

---

## II. Example 1: **Voluntary Contribution Game**

### Setup

* **Players**: 5 individuals (A, B, C, D, E)
* **Initial Endowment**: Each player is given ₹10
* **Strategy**: Each player chooses an integer amount (1 to 10) to contribute to a **common pool**
* **Mechanism**:

  * Total contributions are **doubled**
  * The final amount is then **equally distributed** among all five players

### Game Structure

* **Set of Players**: 5
* **Strategy Set**: Integer contributions from 1 to 10
* **Objective**: Maximize the final amount of money each player retains
* **Interdependence**: The outcome depends not just on one’s own contribution, but also on the contributions of others

> This illustrates a **public goods game**, a classic example in game theory that involves **cooperation vs. free-riding**.

### Real-World Analogy

* A **shirt seller** in a market:
  Your success depends not only on your price and product but also on competitors' pricing and reputation.

---

## III. Example 2: **Grading Game**

### Setup

* **Players**: 2 students
* **Strategies**: Choose either **Alpha** or **Beta**
* **Outcome Matrix**:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | Alpha  | Beta   |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Alpha**           | B−, B− | A, C   |
| **Beta**            | C, A   | B+, B+ |

### Game Structure

* **Set of Players**: 2
* **Strategy Set**: {Alpha, Beta}
* **Objective**: Maximize one's **GPA**
* **Interdependence**: The final grade depends on both players' choices

> Inspired by a classroom exercise from [Professor Ben Polak](https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159) at Yale University, illustrating **strategic interdependence** and **coordination problems**.

---

## IV. Key Concepts Recap

* **Simultaneous Move Game**: All players choose actions at the same time, without knowing others' choices.
* **Strategy**: A complete plan of action available to a player.
* **Optimization Objective**: The specific value (e.g., money, GPA) a player tries to maximize.
* **Interdependence**: A player’s outcome is influenced by their own choice *and* the choices of others.

# Game Theory: Dominant Strategy – Study Guide

---

## What Is a Dominant Strategy?

* A **dominant strategy** is an action that yields a higher payoff **regardless of what others do**.
* Formally, if one strategy always results in a better (or equal) outcome compared to any other strategy—whatever opponents choose—then it is dominant.
* **Practical implication**: When available, players **will choose** their dominant strategy.

---

## Example 1: Voluntary Contribution Game (Simultaneous-Move)

### Setup

* **Players**: A, B, C, D, E (5 total)
* **Endowment**: Each has ₹10
* **Strategies**: Contribute any integer amount from 0 to 10 to a common pool
* **Payoff Structure**:

  * Pool contributions are **doubled** by the experimenter
  * Final sum is **equally shared** among all players

### Analysis: Is “Contribute Nothing” Dominant?

1. **All others give ₹10**

   * Total = ₹40 → Doubled = ₹80 → Each receives ₹16
   * If A contributes ₹0 → A ends with ₹26 (₹0 + ₹16)
   * If A contributes ₹10 → A ends with ₹20
   * **Better off contributing nothing**

2. **All others give ₹0**

   * Total = ₹0 or ₹10 (if A contributes) → Doubled = ₹0 or ₹20 → Shared equally
   * If A contributes ₹0 → A has ₹10
   * If A contributes ₹10 → A ends with ₹4
   * **Again, better off contributing nothing**

**Conclusion**: **Not contributing** is a **dominant strategy**—it maximizes A's payoff regardless of others’ actions.

---

## Example 2: Grading Game (Two-Player Simultaneous)

### Setup

* **Players**: 2 (you and your rival)

* **Choices**: Alpha or Beta

* **Payoff Table** (fictional “points” based on grades):

  | Rival ↓ / You → | Alpha | Beta |
  | --------------- | ----- | ---- |
  | **Alpha**       | 2, 2  | 4, 1 |
  | **Beta**        | 1, 4  | 3, 3 |

* **Objective**: Maximize your own grade (points)

### Analysis: Is “Alpha” Dominant?

* If the rival plays **Alpha**:

  * You choose Alpha → 2 points
  * You choose Beta → 1 point
  * **Alpha is better**

* If the rival plays **Beta**:

  * You choose Alpha → 4 points
  * You choose Beta → 3 points
  * **Alpha is better**

**Conclusion**: **Alpha** is a **dominant strategy** since it always gives a higher payoff than Beta.

---

## Key Insights

* A **dominant strategy** is one that is best across all possible actions by others.
* **Players with dominant strategies will choose them**, but:

  * That doesn't guarantee the overall outcome is **efficient or optimal for the group**.
  * We’ll explore this efficiency vs. individual rationality tension in future videos.



# 🎓 Game Theory: Prisoners' Dilemma & Dominant Strategy – Study Guide

---

## 🧠 What Is the Prisoners' Dilemma?

The **Prisoners' Dilemma** is a foundational concept in game theory where **rational self-interest** leads individuals to a worse collective outcome, even though mutual cooperation would be better for all.

* **Structure**: Each player has a **dominant strategy** to defect (or not cooperate), which is **individually rational**.
* **Problem**: When **all players follow this logic**, the **group ends up worse off** than if they had all cooperated.

🔗 [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)

---

## 🎲 Real-Life Examples Discussed

### 1. **Voluntary Contribution Game**

* **Setup**: 5 players (A–E), each with ₹10
* **Choices**: Contribute any portion (0–10) to a shared pool
* **Mechanism**: Pool is **doubled** and equally redistributed

#### Dominant Strategy Outcome:

* Each player contributes **nothing** (dominant strategy)
* Each keeps ₹10 → Total = ₹50 (across all)

#### Socially Optimal Outcome:

* Everyone contributes ₹10
* Pool = ₹50 → Doubled = ₹100 → Each gets ₹20

🎯 **Conclusion**: Dominant strategy leads to a **Pareto-inefficient** outcome. Cooperation would yield a **higher collective return**.

---

### 2. **Grading Game**

* **Players**: 2
* **Choices**: Alpha or Beta
* **Payoffs**:

  * Alpha–Alpha → B- (2 points each)
  * Beta–Beta → B+ (3 points each)
  * Alpha–Beta → A (4), C (1)

#### Problem:

* **Alpha** is dominant
* Both choose Alpha → Worse off than if both had chosen Beta

---

## 🌍 Global Implication: Climate Change

**The Climate Problem** as a **Prisoners' Dilemma**:

* **Analogy**: Voluntary contribution to climate action
* If **everyone pollutes**, we all lose.
* If **one country acts alone**, the global benefit is small.
* **Free-riding** becomes dominant strategy, but leads to global inefficiency.

🔗 [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

* **Dominant strategies** do not always lead to **desirable group outcomes**.
* The **Prisoners' Dilemma** highlights the tension between **individual rationality** and **collective efficiency**.
* This paradox is central to **policy**, **business strategy**, and **ethics** in decision-making.

---

## 🔮 Next Topic Teaser

> *What happens when **emotions** enter the strategic decision-making process?*

We'll explore whether players still follow dominant strategies when **non-monetary** factors like **fairness**, **reputation**, or **empathy** come into play.

## 📚 Concept Overview

The **Tragedy of the Commons** refers to a situation where **individuals, acting in their own self-interest**, **overuse and deplete shared resources**, leading to **long-term collective loss**.

---

## 🧠 Key Points

* **Commons**: Any **shared, finite resource** (e.g., pastures, air, water, fisheries).
* **Problem**: Each individual benefits from exploiting the resource but **bears only a fraction of the cost**.
* **Result**: **Overconsumption**, degradation, or collapse of the resource.
* **Example**: Overgrazing cattle on a shared field.

---

## 🌎 Modern Implications

* **Environmental degradation**
* **Climate change**
* **Overfishing**
* **Traffic congestion**
* **Data privacy concerns**

---

## 🛠️ Potential Solutions

* **Regulation** (government policies)
* **Privatization**
* **Collective agreements**
* **Technological innovation**

# 🎓 Emotions & Cooperation in Game Theory

---

## Why Emotions Matter

In real-world settings—unlike pure theoretical models—**emotions, relationships, and social bonds** significantly influence choices in strategic games, often leading to more cooperative outcomes.

---

## 👫 Example: Grading Game With Loved Ones

* **Scenario**: You play the Alpha/Beta grading game with close family (e.g., spouse or child).
* **Rational Analysis**: Alpha is still the **dominant strategy** for everyone.
* **Emotional Influence**:

  * With a spouse: You think of the shared outcome—**joint optimization**—and choose Beta.
  * With a child: You may choose Beta to maximize **their happiness**, even at your own expense.
  * With a threat (e.g., facing someone stronger): You might choose Beta to avoid confrontation—even if it's irrationally “optimal.”

---

## 💔 Real-World Classroom Experiments

* In practice, most students still choose Alpha—but a significant **minority choose Beta**, often citing:

  > *“I want to give cooperation a chance.”*

* Among **military cadets**, nearly everyone opts for Beta, reasoning that their partner’s well-being (or mission cohesion) outweighs personal gain.

---

## 🌱 Voluntary Contribution Game: Altruism in Action

* Theoretical dominant strategy: **Contribute nothing.**
* Experimental reality: On average, contributions of **3–4 rupees** are observed.
* This suggests a **willingness to cooperate**, even when the dominant strategy predicts otherwise.

---

## 🛠️ Implications for Management

* **Bringing Alpha‑players to Beta** often hinges on fostering:

  * **Trust**
  * **Team spirit**
  * **Shared identity or values**
* Management strategies must **leverage social bonds and emotional incentives**, not just rational analysis.

---

## 🔭 What’s Next

In upcoming sections, we’ll explore:

* More **corporate examples** of the Prisoners’ Dilemma
* How **self-interest**, emotion, and strategic foresight interact in complex real-world situations

[What is the Tragedy of the Commons? (TED‑Ed)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxC161GvMPc&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## 🌐 Tragedy of the Commons – Key Takeaways

* **Commons** are shared resources (e.g., fisheries, atmosphere, public lands).
* Individuals acting in self-interest can **deplete or degrade** these resources, harming everyone, even though **cooperation would benefit all**. ([en.wikipedia.org][1])
* Solutions include **regulation, privatization**, or **collective management**, as outlined by economists like Garrett Hardin and Elinor Ostrom. ([en.wikipedia.org][1])

---

## 🎯 Real-World Prisoners’ Dilemma in Action

### 1. **Tobacco Advertising Ban (U.S., 1971)**

* Two major tobacco companies face a typical **Prisoners’ Dilemma**: individually, each wants to advertise to gain market share; jointly, not advertising would **eliminate mutual waste** on promotional expenses.
* When the government banned cigarette advertising, **advertising budgets dropped**, **profits increased**, and **stock prices rose**—despite concerns that the ban would be harmful. ([red-files-public.s3.amazonaws.com][2], [reference.findlaw.com][3])
* With no ability to differentiate brands via ads, firms retained about **50% market share each**, cut costs, and **blocked new entrants**, increasing profitability.

---

### 2. **International Nuclear Arms Race**

* Countries face a Prisoners’ Dilemma: **not having nuclear weapons** weakens security, so **everyone builds them**.
* While mutual disarmament would be optimal, a rational, dominant strategy (having bombs) leads to an **arms buildup**—even if it reduces global safety.

---

### 3. **Pharmaceutical Advertising: Patented vs. Generics**

* **In the U.S.**, doctors prescribe drugs by **generic name**, enabling pharmacists to substitute generics. Hence, advertising boosts the entire category—not a single company—reducing its ROI.
* **In India**, doctors write brand names (often for generics). This makes **brand-specific advertising effective**, leading companies to promote generics too.&#x20;
* This difference highlights how **market rules shape firms’ dominant strategies** in a Prisoners’ Dilemma framework.

---

## 🔍 Discussion Points

1. **Dominant strategies** (advertise, arm, brand market) may make sense individually—but lead to **suboptimal collective outcomes**.
2. **Policy interventions**—like the advertising ban or non-proliferation treaties—shift payoffs, aligning private incentives with **improved social welfare**.
3. **Market context** (e.g., generic prescribing laws) can overturn or reinforce strategic incentives.

---

## 🧭 Takeaway Lesson

* Dominant strategies don’t guarantee the best collective outcomes.
* Understanding strategic dynamics allows policymakers and managers to **re-engineer payoffs**—through laws, norms, or market structures—to shift behavior from **competitive** to **cooperative**.
* Whether in advertising, arms control, or environment, **strategic insight drives effective interventions**.

# 📘 Essential Reading: *Crocin or Paracetamol: What Should the Doctor Prescribe?*

**Source**: Mostly Economics (via *Economic & Political Weekly*, October 2013)
**Authors**: Chirantan Chatterjee, Kensuke Kubo, Viswanath Pingali
**[Read the full article](https://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/crocin-or-paracetamol-what-should-the-doctor-prescribe/)**

---

## 🔍 Overview

This article examines the potential regulatory shift in India—from doctors prescribing brand names (e.g., Crocin, Dolo) to prescribing by the **generic molecule name** (e.g., paracetamol). It discusses the potential **benefits** for consumers and **concerns** about quality and market dynamics.

---

## ✅ Advantages of Generic-Prescribing

1. **Lower Prices** – Generic prescriptions could reduce costs, making medicines more affordable.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

2. **Increased Competition** – Ensuring all brands share the market more fairly, potentially lowering costs further.


---

## ⚠️ Risks & Concerns

1. **Quality Variation** – Without strict enforcement of WHO’s Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), cheaper generics might be of lower quality.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

2. **Pharmacist Incentives** – Pharmacists might substitute costlier generics offering higher margins rather than the cheapest or best-quality option.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

3. **Strategic Branding Behaviors** – To stand out, manufacturers may launch branded combinations, which may not always align with clinical best practices.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

4. **Complex Drugs (Biologics)** – For drugs like insulin, proving bioequivalence is technically challenging, complicating substitution decisions.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

---

## 🏥 Policy Implications

* **Regulatory Rigour Needed** – To ensure generic prescriptions work, regulators must enforce consistent quality standards across manufacturers.
  ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

* **Awareness for Patients and Doctors** – Education around generic efficacy is key to counter brand-based perceptions.
  ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

---

## 📌 Relevance to Game Theory

This example reflects a **strategic dilemma** for pharmaceutical players akin to a **Prisoners’ Dilemma**:

* **Brands**: Prefer doctors prescribing generics only if they **can still differentiate** via marketing.
* **Regulation**: Mandating generic names removes differentiation, forcing brands to **compete on quality and cost**.
* **Outcome**: Consumer welfare improves only if **regulation is enforced**, and quality safeguards are maintained.

---

## 🌸 Context & Health Risks

* **Perfumes and cosmetics** often contain complex chemicals—some undisclosed—that can trigger health issues like **allergic reactions**, **asthma**, **dermatitis**, or even **anxiety** in nearly 10% of individuals.&#x20;
* Despite these risks, perfume use is increasing—many wearers are **unwilling to give it up**.

---

## 🔄 The Prisoners’ Dilemma of Beauty

### Scenario:

* If **no one wears perfume**, a woman could gain **no health risk** and maintain her **natural attractiveness**.
* If **others wear perfume**, **beauty standards shift**, making them seem more attractive—even if health risks increase.
* Thus, with **rational self-interest**, individuals wear perfume to “keep up”—despite collective health costs.

### Outcome:

* **Mutual perfume use** becomes the norm.
* Winning attractiveness at the cost of health leads people into a **vicious cycle**.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

* **Individual choice** to wear perfume may seem rational, but collectively it leads to **increased health risks**—a classic Prisoners’ Dilemma.
* Reflects how **social norms** and **indirect pressures** heavily influence private decisions.
* The dilemma persists even when recognizing the risks—because no one wants to be at a perceived disadvantage in attractiveness.

---

## 🧠 Relevance for Game Theory

* Demonstrates how **non-economic factors** (health, beauty norms) drive socially suboptimal equilibrium.
* Shows a game where **dominant strategies** lead to **collective harm**, not just lost efficiency.
* Suggests that intervention (education, regulation, or social change) may be needed to **reset perceptions and standards**.

# 📘 Recommended Reading: *Finessing the Political System—The Cigarette Advertising Ban*

**Authors**: Mitchell, M. L., & Mulherin, J. H.
**Published in**: *Southern Economic Journal*, Vol. 54, No. 4 (Apr. 1988), pp. 855–862
\**[Access Article on JSTOR →](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1059521?seq=3)*

---

## 📌 Summary

This study investigates the **economic impact** of the 1970 ban on cigarette advertising on **major tobacco firms** in the United States. Contrary to expectations that restrictions would harm these firms, the authors find that such regulation actually **boosted profitability and reduced risk** for incumbent players.

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

* **Positive Stock Market Reaction**:
  Using event study methodology, the researchers observed **positive abnormal stock returns** for tobacco firms following the announcement of the advertising ban.

* **Risk Reduction**:
  There was a **significant decline in systematic risk (beta)** for major tobacco companies, indicating a more stable financial outlook post-ban.

* **Less Brand Competition**:
  Since the ban applied to all companies, it **froze brand recognition levels**, limiting the ability of new entrants or smaller brands to compete effectively.

* **Barrier to Entry**:
  The ban created **high entry barriers**, protecting established firms by preventing newcomers from using advertising to build market share.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

* **Prisoner's Dilemma Analogy**:
  Firms were stuck in an advertising arms race. The government-imposed ban effectively **coordinated a “no-advertise” equilibrium**, improving collective industry profitability.

* **Game Theory Lens**:
  The ban enforced cooperation in a non-cooperative industry setting, acting like an **external mechanism to escape a suboptimal dominant strategy outcome**.

* **Policy Insight**:
  Well-targeted regulation can **realign incentives** and lead to more **economically stable industry outcomes**, even for the regulated entities themselves.

## 🔍 Relevance to Game Theory & Strategy

This article is an excellent case study in:

* **Strategic interactions under regulation**
* **Market equilibrium shifts due to policy**
* **The benefits of enforced coordination in Prisoner’s Dilemma-like settings**
* **Stock market as a feedback mechanism for strategic policy changes**

## 📚 Chapter 3: Strategic Moves

Chapter 3 focuses on **strategic moves**—actions a player takes to **influence the future choices** of other players in a game by **altering the game's structure**.

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

* **Commitments**:
  These are irreversible moves that shape others' responses. For example, a firm investing in a costly factory signals commitment to a market.

* **Threats and Promises**:

  * A **threat** is a conditional move: "If you do X, I will do Y to harm you."
  * A **promise** is the opposite: "If you do X, I will reward you with Y."
    Both must be **credible** to influence others’ decisions.

* **Credibility**:
  A strategic move is only effective if **believable**. The authors explain how **reputation, prior actions, contracts, or third-party enforcement** can help establish credibility.

* **Game Examples**:

  * Entry deterrence in markets (e.g., pricing strategies to keep competitors out)
  * Deterrence strategies in military and diplomacy
  * Bargaining situations, like salary negotiations or deal-making

---

## 💡 Practical Applications

* In business, **credible commitments** (like patents, long-term contracts) can discourage competitors.
* In diplomacy, **mutually assured destruction (MAD)** is used as a credible threat to deter aggression.
* In everyday life, even parenting or team sports use strategies of promises and threats to steer behavior.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Thinking Takeaway

Chapter 3 emphasizes that **structure and foresight matter**:

* Think ahead about how others will react.
* Change the game by committing credibly.
* Use threats and promises to align incentives.

# 🎯 Game Theory: Dominant Strategy ≠ Prisoner's Dilemma

## 📌 Key Distinction

* **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that yields a better (or equal) outcome for a player, no matter what the others do.
* **Prisoner's Dilemma**: A specific application of dominant strategy where individual rational choices lead to a worse collective outcome.

## 🧾 Case Study: Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction (Vickrey Auction)

### 🔍 Auction Mechanics

* **Setup**: Each participant submits a sealed bid.
* **Winner**: Highest bidder.
* **Price Paid**: Second-highest bid (not their own).

This format encourages **truthful bidding**: bid = your valuation (B = V).

### 📈 Why B = V Is a Dominant Strategy

1. **Overbidding (B > V)**:

   * You may win but pay more than the item’s value → **negative payoff**.
   * **Worse** than bidding your true valuation.

2. **Underbidding (B < V)**:

   * You risk **losing the item**, even when your value exceeds the second-highest bid.
   * The potential loss in utility outweighs the gain from paying less.
   * \[Exercise suggested: prove this yourself.]

Thus, bidding your **true value** is always safe or better—making it a **dominant strategy**.

---

## ⚠️ Behavioral Insight: Rational Theory vs. Practice

* **Theory**: B = V is optimal (as proven by [William Vickrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vickrey), Nobel Laureate).
* **Practice**: People tend to **overbid** due to:

  * Exuberance about paying less than bid.
  * **Distrust** in others’ rationality.
  * Misconception that overbidding increases winning chances without downside.

# 🧠 What If There Is No Dominant Strategy?

## 🎯 Key Idea

If **no dominant strategy** exists, use the **iterated elimination of dominated strategies (IEDS)** to simplify the game and make rational decisions.

---

## 🧪 Classroom Game: Median Guessing Game

### 👇 Setup

* Announced prize: ₹100
* Each student chooses an integer between **0–100**.
* **Median** of all submitted numbers is computed, then **divided by 2** and **rounded down**.
* The **winner** is the player whose number is closest to (but **not exceeding**) the final value.

### 🎯 Objective

Maximize the chance of being closest to the derived number (median ÷ 2, rounded down).

---

## 🔁 Strategy: Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies

### 1️⃣ **Round 1**:

* Numbers **51–100** are **dominated**: even if everyone plays 100, the median is 100 → result = 50.
* Thus, these numbers can never win.

### 2️⃣ **Round 2**:

* Assume all players have eliminated 51–100.
* Now, median can at most be 50 → result = 25.
* So **26–50** are now also dominated.

### 🔁 Continue Iteration:

* Repeat this process:

  * Eliminate **dominated** numbers each round.
  * Eventually, **only 0** remains as a rational strategy under **full common knowledge** and **perfect rationality**.

## 🧠 Real-World Insight: Level-K Thinking

Despite theoretical elimination leading to **0**:

* **Actual winners** in the class are typically those who pick **18–20**.
* Why? Players anticipate **limited rationality** in others.
* They reason: "Others might not go all the way to 0, so I’ll stop at level-2 or level-3 reasoning."

This is called **[Level-K reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level-K_theory)**:

* **Level-0**: Random behavior or default.
* **Level-1**: Best response to Level-0.
* **Level-2**: Best response to Level-1.
* ... and so on.

# 🗳️ Median Voter Theorem and Iterated Elimination

## 📌 Concept Overview

The **Median Voter Theorem**, attributed to economist [Harold Hotelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law), explains why in a **two-candidate election**, both candidates tend to converge their positions toward the **median voter's** preferences.

---

## 🧠 Assumptions and Setup

* **Two candidates** competing for votes on a single **polarizing issue**.
* Issue positions range from **1 (extreme left)** to **10 (extreme right)**.
* **Voters are uniformly distributed** (10% per position).
* Each voter votes for the **closest candidate** in terms of ideological position.
* **Each candidate wants to maximize vote share** (not just win).

---

## 🔄 Strategic Logic: Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies

1. **Extreme positions are eliminated first**:

   * Position **2** is always better than **1**.
   * Position **9** is always better than **10**.
   * ⇒ **Eliminate 1 and 10**.

2. Repeat the logic:

   * Now, **3** is better than **2**, and **8** is better than **9**.
   * ⇒ **Eliminate 2 and 9**.

3. Continue iteratively:

   * Eventually, only **positions 5 and 6** remain as **undominated**.

---

## 🧭 Result: Candidate Convergence to the Center

* Both candidates will **strategically choose position 5 or 6** to capture the **median voter**.
* **Why?** Because moving away from the median reduces vote share under rational assumptions.

---

## ⚠️ Important Caveats

* The theorem assumes:

  * **Two players only** – It doesn't hold with more than two candidates.
  * **Single-issue** decision space – Multi-issue models are more complex.
  * **Uniform voter distribution** – In real life, voter ideology may be skewed.

* In more complex (e.g., grid or spatial) settings, **Euclidean distance functions** might be used instead of simple linear ones.
