**Rationality, Common Knowledge, and Game Definitions**

---

## I. Two Fundamental Assumptions of Game Theory

### 1. **Rationality**

* **Definition**: Rationality, in the context of game theory, is the idea that individuals **optimize**. This could be minimizing costs, maximizing utility, or choosing optimal strategies given market conditions.
* **Common Misconception**: People often equate rationality with being emotionless. The lecturer argues that emotions can be rational—what matters is whether decisions optimize outcomes.
* **Practical Examples**:

  * A firm setting prices to maximize profit.
  * An individual deciding how much money to save.

#### Are Humans Rational?

* The question of whether humans are rational is central to the field of [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics).
* Behavioral economics identifies **systematic deviations** from rationality and has led to multiple [Nobel Prizes](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/).
* Despite imperfections, **rationality serves as a useful benchmark** for modeling and understanding behavior.

---

### 2. **Common Knowledge**

* **Definition**: Common knowledge goes beyond knowing a fact; it includes knowing that others know it, and knowing that others know that others know it—recursively.
* **Illustrative Example**: In the green-eyed prisoner problem, all prisoners know that others have green eyes. But only when this becomes *common knowledge* do they act.

> Knowing ≠ Common Knowledge

* **Formalization**:

  * "I am rational."
  * "I know that you are rational."
  * "You know that I know that you are rational."
  * ...and so on ad infinitum.

## II. What Is a Game?

### Elements of a Game:

1. **Players**: A finite or countable number (1, 2, 3... *n*).
2. **Strategies**: Each player has a defined set of possible actions.
3. **Objectives**: Each player is trying to **optimize** their outcome, taking into account what others are doing.

### Distinction from General Optimization:

* Not all optimization problems are games.
* **Non-Game Example**: Choosing between chocolate and vanilla ice cream at a fixed price is optimization, but **not a game**—no other player's actions affect your payoff.
* **Game Example**: Your payoff depends on both **your strategy and others' strategies**.

---

## III. Key Concepts and Terms

* **Rationality**: Optimizing behavior, not necessarily devoid of emotion.
* **Common Knowledge**: Mutually recognized and recursively known information among players.
* **Game**: A strategic interaction where each participant's outcome depends on others' actions.
* **Strategy**: A complete plan of action for every possible situation in a game.

## IV. Recommended Pre-Viewing

* **Video Prerequisite**: *The Mad Dictator and the Green-Eyed Prisoners*
  This illustrates the **difference between knowing and common knowledge** and is foundational for understanding the example in this lecture.


# Game Theory Examples: Simultaneous Move Games

---

## I. Overview

This section expands on the foundational ideas of **[game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)** by introducing **simultaneous move games**—games where all players choose their actions at the same time without knowing others' choices.

> In future sections, the discussion will extend to **sequential move games**, **games under uncertainty**, and more.

---

## II. Example 1: **Voluntary Contribution Game**

### Setup

* **Players**: 5 individuals (A, B, C, D, E)
* **Initial Endowment**: Each player is given ₹10
* **Strategy**: Each player chooses an integer amount (1 to 10) to contribute to a **common pool**
* **Mechanism**:

  * Total contributions are **doubled**
  * The final amount is then **equally distributed** among all five players

### Game Structure

* **Set of Players**: 5
* **Strategy Set**: Integer contributions from 1 to 10
* **Objective**: Maximize the final amount of money each player retains
* **Interdependence**: The outcome depends not just on one’s own contribution, but also on the contributions of others

> This illustrates a **public goods game**, a classic example in game theory that involves **cooperation vs. free-riding**.

### Real-World Analogy

* A **shirt seller** in a market:
  Your success depends not only on your price and product but also on competitors' pricing and reputation.

---

## III. Example 2: **Grading Game**

### Setup

* **Players**: 2 students
* **Strategies**: Choose either **Alpha** or **Beta**
* **Outcome Matrix**:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | Alpha  | Beta   |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Alpha**           | B−, B− | A, C   |
| **Beta**            | C, A   | B+, B+ |

### Game Structure

* **Set of Players**: 2
* **Strategy Set**: {Alpha, Beta}
* **Objective**: Maximize one's **GPA**
* **Interdependence**: The final grade depends on both players' choices

> Inspired by a classroom exercise from [Professor Ben Polak](https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159) at Yale University, illustrating **strategic interdependence** and **coordination problems**.

---

## IV. Key Concepts Recap

* **Simultaneous Move Game**: All players choose actions at the same time, without knowing others' choices.
* **Strategy**: A complete plan of action available to a player.
* **Optimization Objective**: The specific value (e.g., money, GPA) a player tries to maximize.
* **Interdependence**: A player’s outcome is influenced by their own choice *and* the choices of others.



# 📘 Essential Reading: *Making Game Theory Work for Managers*

**Authors**: Hannes Lindstädt & Jochen Müller
**Publication**: McKinsey & Company, December 1, 2009
**[Read the Full Article →](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/making-game-theory-work-for-managers)**

---

## 🧠 Summary

This article introduces a **new game-theoretic model** developed through practical application in **European passenger rail deregulation**. It offers a more dynamic and actionable approach to strategy for managers.

---

## 🚀 Key Features of the Model

* **Generates strategic options**: Presents a spectrum of responses rather than a single prescriptive outcome.
* **Balances risk and opportunity**: Helps identify robust strategies under uncertainty.
* **Incorporates dynamic market factors**:

  * Demand variability
  * Cost asymmetries
  * Network advantages
  * Price sensitivity

---

## 🔍 Practical Applications

* **Strategic decision-making** in deregulated or competitive markets
* **Scenario planning** where multiple competitors interact over time
* **Policy simulations** for anticipating rival moves and market responses

---

## 🏢 Managerial Relevance

* Translates **abstract game theory** into **actionable insights** for executives
* Supports **real-world decision-making** in complex, competitive environments
* Encourages proactive rather than reactive strategy formation

**[Read the Full Article →](https://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/why-we-do-not-try-to-walk-off-without-paying-after-a-tax-ride/)**

---

## 🧠 Summary

This article explores the **economic and behavioral rationale** behind why people typically pay taxi fares, even when **no enforcement mechanism** (like police or legal threat) is present.

---

## 🔍 Key Points

* **Traditional Economics View**: Assumes individuals act out of **fear of punishment** or **retaliation**, which deters dishonest behavior.
* **Behavioral Economics Insight**:

  * **Social norms** and **internalized moral values** play a crucial role.
  * People act ethically **even without surveillance**, guided by a sense of **fairness** or **social responsibility**.

---

## 🚕 Real-World Illustration

* Paying after a taxi ride is used as a case to challenge pure rationality assumptions in economics.
* Highlights the **gap between theoretical incentives** and **actual human behavior**.
* Suggests that **trust-based systems** may work due to **collective moral standards**, not just enforcement.

---

## 🎯 Relevance to Game Theory & Economics

* Supports the **behavioral critique** of the rational agent model.
* Illustrates **non-strategic cooperative behavior** in one-shot, low-stakes games.
* Underscores the **importance of intrinsic motivation** and **social expectations** in economic decisions.
