# Game Theory (ECON 159, Yale) — Introductory Notes

## What is Game Theory?

Game Theory is defined as **a method of studying strategic situations**.  
A **strategic situation** is one where **outcomes depend not only on your own actions but also on the actions of others**.  

- **Non-strategic settings**:  
  - *Perfect competition*: Firms are price takers, no need to consider rivals.  
  - *Monopoly*: A single firm faces demand directly, with no competitors.  
- **Strategic settings**: Everything in between — e.g., in the **motor industry**, Ford must consider what GM and Toyota do, since their actions affect each other.

---

## Applications of Game Theory

- **Economics**: Core applications in markets and firm competition.  
- **Politics**: Strategic interactions in voting, coalition-building, diplomacy.  
- **Law**: Increasingly used in legal analysis and courtroom strategies.  
- **Biology**: Applied to **evolutionary dynamics** and survival strategies.  
- **Sport**: Strategies in competitive games and athletic contests.

## Key Concepts and Lessons

### 1. Payoffs and Objectives
- To analyse a game, we must know **what players care about** (their **payoffs**).  
- Payoffs are expressed in *utilities* (what players want to maximise).  
- Changing payoffs changes the game’s logic.  
- **Lesson:** *“You can’t get what you want unless you know what you want.”*

### 2. Strictly Dominated Strategies
- **Definition**: A strategy *strictly dominates* another if it always gives a higher payoff, no matter what others do.  
- **Lesson One:** *Do not play a strictly dominated strategy.*

### 3. Rational Choices Can Lead to Bad Outcomes
- Rational players may still end up in **collectively inefficient outcomes**.  
- **Lesson Two:** Rational individual choices can produce **Pareto-inefficient results**.

### 4. The Prisoner’s Dilemma
- **Classic Example:** Two suspects each face the choice to *confess* (betray) or *stay silent*. Confessing is individually rational but leads to a worse joint outcome.  
- **Real-World Examples:**
  - Roommates not cleaning a dorm room.  
  - Divorce battles escalating.  
  - Price wars in oligopolies.  
- **Remedies:**
  - **Collusion** (though often illegal).  
  - **Repeated interactions** (builds cooperation over time).  
  - **External enforcement** (contracts, or even mafia enforcement).  
  - **Communication alone is insufficient** without enforcement.

### 5. Putting Yourself in Others’ Shoes
- Strategic thinking requires **understanding others’ payoffs** and predicting their actions.  
- **Lesson Four:** Put yourself in others’ shoes to anticipate strategies.  

---

## Classroom Games

### Game 1: “Grade Scheme”
- Choices: **Alpha** or **Beta**.  
- Outcomes affect both a student and their paired partner.  
- Explored under two payoff assumptions:  
  - **“Evil gits”**: Care only about their own grades. → Alpha is strictly dominant.  
  - **“Indignant angels”**: Care about fairness (guilt/indignation included). → Coordination problem.  

**Observations:**  
- Typical experiments: ~70% choose Alpha, ~30% Beta.  
- In Yale’s class: 238 chose Alpha, 36 chose Beta (~15% Beta).  
- **Lesson Five (humorous):** *“Yale students are evil.”*

### Game 2: “Pick a Number”
- Students choose an integer **1–100**.  
- Winner: closest to **⅔ of the class average**.  
- Illustrates **iterative reasoning** and the [Keynesian beauty contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest).

# Strategic Thinking in Game Theory (ECON 159, Yale)

Strategic thinking is fundamentally about **navigating strategic situations**.  
A **strategic situation** is a setting where **outcomes depend not just on your own actions, but also on the actions of others**.  

This contrasts with **non-strategic settings**, such as:  
- **Perfect competition**: Firms are price takers, unconcerned with rivals.  
- **Monopoly**: A single firm faces the market directly, with no competitors.  

Game Theory provides a framework for analysing these interdependent scenarios.

---

## Lesson Four: The Essence of Strategic Thinking
Professor Ben Polak identifies the essence of strategic thinking as:  

> *“The ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes, figure out what their payoffs are, and try to figure out what they’re going to do.”*

This requires moving beyond self-focus and recognising: **“It’s not all about you.”**

---

## Core Components and Lessons in Strategic Thinking

### 1. Understanding Payoffs and Objectives
- To analyse any game, we must know what players **care about** (their **payoffs**).  
- Game Theory does not prescribe goals but helps players achieve them once defined.  
- **Lesson:** *“You can’t get what you want unless you know what you want.”*  
- Different payoff structures → very different outcomes.  
  - **“Evil gits”**: care only about their own grades.  
  - **“Indignant angels”**: factor in guilt or indignation.

---

### 2. Avoiding Strictly Dominated Strategies
- A strategy **strictly dominates** another if it always yields a higher payoff, regardless of opponents’ actions.  
- **Lesson One:** *Do not play a strictly dominated strategy.*  
- Playing a dominated strategy is irrational since the alternative guarantees a better result in every case.

---

### 3. Rational Choices Can Lead to Bad Outcomes
- **Lesson Two:** Rational decisions (like avoiding dominated strategies) can still produce outcomes that are **inefficient** or **collectively undesirable**.  
- **The Prisoner’s Dilemma** illustrates this:  
  - Two suspects betray each other to minimise risk, but both end up worse off.  
- **Real-world examples**:  
  - Messy shared dorm rooms.  
  - Divorce conflicts.  
  - Price wars between firms.  

---

### 4. Anticipating Opponents’ Strategic Reasoning
- Strategic thinking requires **forecasting others’ moves based on their payoffs**.  
- Example:  
  - An **indignant angel** vs. an **evil git**.  
  - The angel lacks a dominant strategy but recognises that the git’s dominant strategy is **Alpha**.  
  - Best response: also choose **Alpha**, even if the result is poor, since it’s optimal given the opponent’s predictable choice.

---

### 5. Dealing with Incomplete Information
- Often, one doesn’t know the opponent’s exact payoffs.  
- Must estimate: *Am I playing against an “evil git” or an “indignant angel”?*  
- This introduces **probabilistic reasoning** in strategy selection.  
  See: [Bayesian games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_game)

---

### 6. Considering Observed Behaviour
- Theory predicts that dominated strategies shouldn’t be chosen, but experiments show deviations:  
  - **~30%** of people (in non-Yale studies) choose dominated strategies.  
  - Reasons: morality, assuming it’s a repeated game, or error (“stupidity”).  
- In Yale’s class: only **~15%** chose the dominated strategy.  
  - **Lesson Five (humorous):** *“Yale students are evil.”*  
  - Reflects stronger adherence to rational self-interest.

---

## Summary

Strategic thinking in Game Theory is a **blend of skills**:
- Rational self-interest (avoid dominated strategies).  
- Empathy for opponents’

# Payoffs and Outcomes in Game Theory (ECON 159, Yale)

In **Game Theory**, as taught in Yale’s Economics 159, **outcomes** and **payoffs** are the foundation for analysing **strategic situations**.

---

## Outcomes

An **outcome** is the direct result of players’ combined actions.  
It depends not just on one’s own decision, but also on the decisions of others.

**Example: Game 1 (Grade Scheme)**  
Students choose between **Alpha** or **Beta**.  
The grades (outcomes) depend on both players:

- **Alpha + Beta** → Alpha player gets **A**, Beta player gets **C**.  
- **Alpha + Alpha** → Both get **B-**.  
- **Beta + Alpha** → Beta player gets **C**, Alpha player gets **A**.  
- **Beta + Beta** → Both get **B+**.  

These are typically organised in an **outcome matrix**, where the **row player’s grade** is listed first and the **column player’s grade** second.

---

## Payoffs

While outcomes describe what happens, **payoffs** represent what players **care about** (objectives or utilities).  
- Payoffs are expressed numerically as **utiles** or **utilities**.  
- Game Theory does not dictate what payoffs *should* be, but once defined, it helps players optimise given their goals.

---

## Payoff Profiles in Game 1

### 1. **“Evil Gits”**  
- Care only about their own grades.  
- Prefer **A > B+ > B- > C**.  
- For them, **Alpha strictly dominates Beta**, because it always produces a higher payoff regardless of the opponent’s choice.  

➡️ Rational choice: play **Alpha**.  
- Collective result: both often end up with **B- (0 payoff)**, which is worse than **B+ (1 payoff)** if both had played Beta.  
- **Lesson Two:** Rational individual choices can lead to outcomes that *“suck”* (i.e., **Pareto inefficient**).

---

### 2. **“Indignant Angels”**  
- Care about grades **and** feelings like guilt or indignation.  
  - Guilt: earning an **A** while the partner gets a **C** reduces payoff.  
  - Indignation: receiving a **C** because of another’s Alpha move feels worse than just the grade itself.  
- In this profile, there is **no strictly dominant strategy**.  

➡️ Outcomes depend more on coordination and mutual expectations.

---

## The Relationship: Payoffs Matter

The key lesson: **changing what people care about (their payoffs) changes the entire game**, even if the actions and outcomes remain the same.  

> *“You can’t get what you want unless you know what you want.”* – Joe Jackson (quoted by Professor Polak)

Thus, correctly identifying payoffs is a prerequisite for meaningful strategic analysis.

---

## Strategic Implications

- Outcomes show **what happens**.  
- Payoffs reveal **why players care** and therefore **how they will act**.  
- Strategic thinking (Lesson Four) requires:  
  - Putting yourself in **others’ shoes**,  
  - Inferring their **payoffs**,  
  - Anticipating their **choices**,  
  - And adjusting your own strategy accordingly.

---

# Dominant Strategies in Game Theory (ECON 159, Yale)

In **Game Theory**, a **dominant strategy** is a cornerstone of rational decision-making.  
Professor Ben Polak introduces this concept early in *Economics 159* to guide students’ understanding of strategic interactions.

---

## Definition: Strictly Dominant Strategy

A **strictly dominant strategy** is defined as:

> *“We say that my strategy Alpha strictly dominates my strategy Beta, if my payoff from Alpha is **strictly greater than that from Beta, regardless of what others do**.”*

This means:  
- No matter what the opponent chooses, playing the dominant strategy guarantees a strictly better payoff.  
- Rational players should avoid any **strictly dominated strategy**.

---

## Lesson One: Do Not Play a Strictly Dominated Strategy

- **Lesson One** of the course:  
  > *“Do not play a strictly dominated strategy.”*  
- Reason: choosing the dominating strategy ensures better results in **every possible case**.  
- This rule is considered almost "too obvious," yet it is a critical foundation.

---

## Illustration: *Evil Gits* in Game 1

**Game 1 (Grade Scheme)** demonstrates this concept.  
When players are **“evil gits”** (who only care about their own grade):

- If the partner chooses **Alpha**:  
  - Alpha → **B- (0 payoff)**  
  - Beta → **C (-1 payoff)**  
  - → Alpha is better (0 > -1).
- If the partner chooses **Beta**:  
  - Alpha → **A (3 payoff)**  
  - Beta → **B+ (1 payoff)**  
  - → Alpha is better (3 > 1).

➡️ **Alpha strictly dominates Beta**.  
An "evil git" should always choose Alpha.

---

## Lesson Two: Rational Choices Can Lead to Bad Outcomes

Despite being rational, dominant strategies may lead to collectively worse results:

- Two “evil gits” both choose **Alpha** → both get **B- (0 payoff)**.  
- If both had chosen **Beta**, they’d each get **B+ (1 payoff)**.  

This inefficiency is the essence of the **Prisoner’s Dilemma**.  
- Rational choice → **suboptimal collective outcome**.  
- Lesson Two: Rationality can lead to results that *“suck”* or are **Pareto inefficient**.

---

## Absence of Dominant Strategies: *Indignant Angels*

When payoffs change, strategy dominance may disappear.

- **Indignant angels** care about grades **and** emotions (guilt, indignation).  
- If the partner chooses **Alpha**:  
  - Alpha → **0 payoff**, Beta → **-3 payoff** → Alpha is better.  
- If the partner chooses **Beta**:  
  - Alpha → **-1 payoff**, Beta → **1 payoff** → Beta is better.  

➡️ **No strictly dominant strategy exists**.  
The best response depends on what the opponent does.

---

## Lesson Four: Anticipating Others’ Dominant Strategies

Strategic thinking requires:  

> *“Putting yourself in someone else’s shoes, figuring out their payoffs, and predicting what they’re going to do.”*

- Example: *Indignant angel vs. Evil git*  
  - Angel lacks a dominant strategy.  
  - Git’s dominant strategy is **Alpha**.  
  - Angel anticipates Git’s choice and responds with **Alpha** (0 payoff) instead of Beta (-3 payoff).  
- Even without a personal dominant strategy, one can optimise by **anticipating an opponent’s dominant choice**.

---

## Empirical Observations

Experiments reveal that people don’t always behave “rationally”:

- Roughly **30% of participants** in standard Prisoner’s Dilemma studies (e.g., University of Arizona undergraduates) choose dominated strategies.  
  - Possible reasons: morality, belief it’s a repeated game, or simple error.  
- At Yale: only **~15% chose the dominated strategy (Beta)** in Game 1.  
  - Humorous **Lesson Five:** *“Yale students are evil.”*  
  - Interpreted as Yale students being more consistently self-interested and rational.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Strictly dominant strategies** always yield better payoffs than their alternatives.  
2. **Lesson One:** never play a strictly dominated strategy.  
3. **Lesson Two:** rational players may still reach inefficient outcomes (Prisoner’s Dilemma).  
4. **Lesson Four:** anticipate others’ dominant strategies to inform your best response.  
5. **Lesson Five:** experimental evidence reveals variation in behaviour, sometimes deviating from rational theory.

# Rational Choice and Its Limitations in Game Theory (ECON 159, Yale)

In **Game Theory**, as introduced in *Economics 159* at Yale, **rational choice** begins with the principle of avoiding **strictly dominated strategies**.  

- A strategy is **strictly dominated** if another strategy always yields a higher payoff, regardless of what others do.  
- **Lesson One:** *“Do not play a strictly dominated strategy.”*  
- Reason: the dominating strategy guarantees a better result in every case, making it the rational choice for an individual.

---

## Lesson Two: Rational Choice Can Lead to Bad Outcomes

The first major limitation of rational choice is highlighted in **Lesson Two**:  

> *“Rational choice can lead to outcomes that suck.”*  

Formally: individually rational strategies may result in outcomes that are **collectively undesirable** or **Pareto inefficient**.

---

## The Prisoner’s Dilemma

The classic illustration of this paradox is the **Prisoner’s Dilemma**.

### Scenario
- Two suspects, held separately, face the choice to **cooperate (stay silent)** or **defect (rat out the other)**.  
- Payoffs (example):  
  - Both stay silent → 1 year each.  
  - Both defect → 2 years each.  
  - One defects, the other silent → defector goes free, silent partner gets 5 years.  

### Rational Choice Leads to Bad Outcomes
- For each individual, defecting is always better regardless of what the other does.  
- **Defection is the strictly dominant strategy.**  
- Result: both defect and receive 2 years each.  
- But if both had stayed silent, they’d only serve 1 year each.  

➡️ Rational self-interest produces a **worse collective outcome** than cooperation.

---

## Specific Limitations of Rational Choice

1. **Failure of Magical Reasoning**  
   - Players sometimes hope that if *they* choose the cooperative option, others will “magically” do the same.  
   - The professor calls this mistaken assumption “ESP reasoning.”  
   - In reality, one’s reasoning does not influence others’ choices in a one-shot game.

2. **Conflict Between Individual and Collective Rationality**  
   - Even if everyone agreed to cooperate, each individual would still have an incentive to defect for a better personal payoff.  
   - Thus, collective welfare often conflicts with individual rationality.

3. **Real-World Parallels**  
   - **Dorm rooms:** Each roommate prefers the other to clean, leading to a messy room.  
   - **Divorce battles:** Escalating legal costs may be individually rational but ruinous for both parties.  
   - **Price competition:** Firms undercut competitors to gain market share, driving down overall profits.

---

## Empirical Deviations from Strict Rationality

While Game Theory predicts rational defection, human behaviour often deviates:

- In experiments, about **30% of participants choose dominated strategies** (e.g., cooperation in Prisoner’s Dilemma).  
- Possible explanations:  
  - **Morality:** concern for others’ well-being.  
  - **Repeated-game intuition:** mistaken belief the game will repeat, making cooperation pay off.  
  - **Confusion (“stupidity”):** misunderstanding the game.

**Yale’s results:**  
- Only **~15%** of students chose the dominated strategy (cooperation in Game 1).  
- Humorous **Lesson Five:** *“Yale students are evil.”*  
- Interpreted as greater adherence to self-interested rationality compared to other study groups (e.g., Arizona undergraduates).

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Lesson One:** Never play a strictly dominated strategy.  
- **Lesson Two:** Rational choice can yield inefficient outcomes.  
- The **Prisoner’s Dilemma** exemplifies how individually rational strategies can lead to collectively worse results.  
- Real-world decision-making often deviates from pure rationality due to morality, expectations of repetition, or errors.  

Game Theory therefore balances between **theoretical rationality** and **observed behaviour**, acknowledging both the power and the limitations of rational choice.

2. List three real-world fields or areas outside of economics where Game Theory is applied, as mentioned in the lecture.  
3. Describe the grading structure for the course, including the weight of problem sets, the mid-term, and the final.

5. In the Grade Game (Game 1), explain the concept of a "strictly dominant strategy" using the "Evil Git" payoffs as an example.  
6. Why did the professor argue that the reasoning *“if we both chose Beta, we'd both get B+, so I should choose Beta”* for "Evil Gits" in the Grade Game is flawed?  
7. What is the "Prisoner's Dilemma," and what is one real-world example of it provided in the lecture?  
8. How can repetition of an interaction serve as a remedy for a Prisoner's Dilemma, even without a formal contract?

10. Based on the experimental results for the Grade Game, what is "Lesson 5" about Yale students, and what does it suggest about their decision-making?  

---

### Answer Key

1. A strategic situation is one where outcomes depend not just on one’s own actions but also on the actions of others. Non-strategic situations are those where outcomes depend solely on individual actions, such as monopolists or firms in perfect competition.  

2. Game Theory is applied in politics, law, and biology (especially in evolution). It also finds applications in sport.  

3. The grading structure is: **30% problem sets, 30% mid-term exam, 40% final exam**. The mid-term is held in class on **October 17th**.  

4. The professor does not follow the textbooks strictly. Instead, he uses them as **safety nets** for students to reinforce or clarify concepts outside of lecture.  

5. For "Evil Gits," Alpha strictly dominates Beta because Alpha always yields a higher payoff regardless of the partner’s choice. For example, Alpha leads to 0 or 3 points versus Beta’s −1 or 1, making Alpha strictly better in all cases.  

6. That reasoning is flawed because it relies on “magical reasoning” — the assumption that one’s choice influences the opponent’s. Rational choice must account for what others will actually do, and for "Evil Gits," Alpha is still the best response.  

7. The Prisoner’s Dilemma is a game where individually rational choices produce worse collective outcomes. An example is **messy dorm rooms**, where each roommate avoids cleaning, leading to a dirty room for both.  

8. Repetition enables cooperation by allowing players to build reputations and punish defection in future rounds. Even without a contract, the shadow of the future makes cooperation a rational long-term strategy.  

9. As an Indignant Angel, you should choose Alpha because the Evil Git will rationally choose Alpha (their dominant strategy). Your best response to their Alpha is also Alpha, which yields 0 instead of −3 if you chose Beta.  

10. Lesson 5 is that *“Yale students are evil”* (stated humorously). It suggests Yale students are more inclined toward rational, self-interested decision-making, as fewer chose the dominated Beta strategy compared to other student populations.  

---

## Essay Questions

1. Analyse the implications of rational choice leading to "bad outcomes" (Lesson 2) in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma. Discuss how this concept challenges traditional economic assumptions and provide examples beyond those given in the lecture.  
2. Compare and contrast the "Evil Gits" and "Indignant Angels" payoff structures in Game 1. Explain how changing the assumed payoffs fundamentally alters the strategic analysis and potential outcomes of the game, highlighting the significance of "payoffs matter" (Lesson 3).  
3. Discuss the role of enforcement mechanisms in resolving Prisoner's Dilemmas. Examine why simple communication is insufficient and elaborate on the various "remedies" for cooperation, both legal and extralegal, as mentioned in the lecture.  
4. Explain the importance of "putting yourself in others' shoes" (Lesson 4) as a core aspect of strategic thinking. Illustrate this concept by comparing the analytical process in the "Evil Git vs. Evil Git" scenario with the "Indignant Angel vs. Evil Git" scenario.  
5. Beyond the "bad hair day release form," critically evaluate the administrative aspects of the Game Theory course. Discuss how the grading structure, textbook approach, and class videoing might influence student engagement and learning, considering both the professor's intentions and potential student perspectives.
