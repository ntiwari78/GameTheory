# Game Theory Fundamentals: Study Guide

**Rationality, Common Knowledge, and Game Definitions**

---

## I. Two Fundamental Assumptions of Game Theory

### 1. **Rationality**

* **Definition**: Rationality, in the context of game theory, is the idea that individuals **optimize**. This could be minimizing costs, maximizing utility, or choosing optimal strategies given market conditions.
* **Common Misconception**: People often equate rationality with being emotionless. The lecturer argues that emotions can be rational—what matters is whether decisions optimize outcomes.
* **Practical Examples**:

  * A firm setting prices to maximize profit.
  * An individual deciding how much money to save.

#### Are Humans Rational?

* The question of whether humans are rational is central to the field of [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics).
* Behavioral economics identifies **systematic deviations** from rationality and has led to multiple [Nobel Prizes](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/).
* Despite imperfections, **rationality serves as a useful benchmark** for modeling and understanding behavior.

---

### 2. **Common Knowledge**

* **Definition**: Common knowledge goes beyond knowing a fact; it includes knowing that others know it, and knowing that others know that others know it—recursively.
* **Illustrative Example**: In the green-eyed prisoner problem, all prisoners know that others have green eyes. But only when this becomes *common knowledge* do they act.

> Knowing ≠ Common Knowledge

* **Formalization**:

  * "I am rational."
  * "I know that you are rational."
  * "You know that I know that you are rational."
  * ...and so on ad infinitum.

---

## II. What Is a Game?

### Elements of a Game:

1. **Players**: A finite or countable number (1, 2, 3... *n*).
2. **Strategies**: Each player has a defined set of possible actions.
3. **Objectives**: Each player is trying to **optimize** their outcome, taking into account what others are doing.

### Distinction from General Optimization:

* Not all optimization problems are games.
* **Non-Game Example**: Choosing between chocolate and vanilla ice cream at a fixed price is optimization, but **not a game**—no other player's actions affect your payoff.
* **Game Example**: Your payoff depends on both **your strategy and others' strategies**.

---

## III. Key Concepts and Terms

* **Rationality**: Optimizing behavior, not necessarily devoid of emotion.
* **Common Knowledge**: Mutually recognized and recursively known information among players.
* **Game**: A strategic interaction where each participant's outcome depends on others' actions.
* **Strategy**: A complete plan of action for every possible situation in a game.

---

## IV. Recommended Pre-Viewing

* **Video Prerequisite**: *The Mad Dictator and the Green-Eyed Prisoners*
  This illustrates the **difference between knowing and common knowledge** and is foundational for understanding the example in this lecture.


# Game Theory Examples: Simultaneous Move Games

---

## I. Overview

This section expands on the foundational ideas of **[game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)** by introducing **simultaneous move games**—games where all players choose their actions at the same time without knowing others' choices.

> In future sections, the discussion will extend to **sequential move games**, **games under uncertainty**, and more.

---

## II. Example 1: **Voluntary Contribution Game**

### Setup

* **Players**: 5 individuals (A, B, C, D, E)
* **Initial Endowment**: Each player is given ₹10
* **Strategy**: Each player chooses an integer amount (1 to 10) to contribute to a **common pool**
* **Mechanism**:

  * Total contributions are **doubled**
  * The final amount is then **equally distributed** among all five players

### Game Structure

* **Set of Players**: 5
* **Strategy Set**: Integer contributions from 1 to 10
* **Objective**: Maximize the final amount of money each player retains
* **Interdependence**: The outcome depends not just on one’s own contribution, but also on the contributions of others

> This illustrates a **public goods game**, a classic example in game theory that involves **cooperation vs. free-riding**.

### Real-World Analogy

* A **shirt seller** in a market:
  Your success depends not only on your price and product but also on competitors' pricing and reputation.

---

## III. Example 2: **Grading Game**

### Setup

* **Players**: 2 students
* **Strategies**: Choose either **Alpha** or **Beta**
* **Outcome Matrix**:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | Alpha  | Beta   |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Alpha**           | B−, B− | A, C   |
| **Beta**            | C, A   | B+, B+ |

### Game Structure

* **Set of Players**: 2
* **Strategy Set**: {Alpha, Beta}
* **Objective**: Maximize one's **GPA**
* **Interdependence**: The final grade depends on both players' choices

> Inspired by a classroom exercise from [Professor Ben Polak](https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159) at Yale University, illustrating **strategic interdependence** and **coordination problems**.

---

## IV. Key Concepts Recap

* **Simultaneous Move Game**: All players choose actions at the same time, without knowing others' choices.
* **Strategy**: A complete plan of action available to a player.
* **Optimization Objective**: The specific value (e.g., money, GPA) a player tries to maximize.
* **Interdependence**: A player’s outcome is influenced by their own choice *and* the choices of others.

# Game Theory: Dominant Strategy – Study Guide

---

## What Is a Dominant Strategy?

* A **dominant strategy** is an action that yields a higher payoff **regardless of what others do**.
* Formally, if one strategy always results in a better (or equal) outcome compared to any other strategy—whatever opponents choose—then it is dominant.
* **Practical implication**: When available, players **will choose** their dominant strategy.

---

## Example 1: Voluntary Contribution Game (Simultaneous-Move)

### Setup

* **Players**: A, B, C, D, E (5 total)
* **Endowment**: Each has ₹10
* **Strategies**: Contribute any integer amount from 0 to 10 to a common pool
* **Payoff Structure**:

  * Pool contributions are **doubled** by the experimenter
  * Final sum is **equally shared** among all players

### Analysis: Is “Contribute Nothing” Dominant?

1. **All others give ₹10**

   * Total = ₹40 → Doubled = ₹80 → Each receives ₹16
   * If A contributes ₹0 → A ends with ₹26 (₹0 + ₹16)
   * If A contributes ₹10 → A ends with ₹20
   * **Better off contributing nothing**

2. **All others give ₹0**

   * Total = ₹0 or ₹10 (if A contributes) → Doubled = ₹0 or ₹20 → Shared equally
   * If A contributes ₹0 → A has ₹10
   * If A contributes ₹10 → A ends with ₹4
   * **Again, better off contributing nothing**

**Conclusion**: **Not contributing** is a **dominant strategy**—it maximizes A's payoff regardless of others’ actions.

---

## Example 2: Grading Game (Two-Player Simultaneous)

### Setup

* **Players**: 2 (you and your rival)

* **Choices**: Alpha or Beta

* **Payoff Table** (fictional “points” based on grades):

  | Rival ↓ / You → | Alpha | Beta |
  | --------------- | ----- | ---- |
  | **Alpha**       | 2, 2  | 4, 1 |
  | **Beta**        | 1, 4  | 3, 3 |

* **Objective**: Maximize your own grade (points)

### Analysis: Is “Alpha” Dominant?

* If the rival plays **Alpha**:

  * You choose Alpha → 2 points
  * You choose Beta → 1 point
  * **Alpha is better**

* If the rival plays **Beta**:

  * You choose Alpha → 4 points
  * You choose Beta → 3 points
  * **Alpha is better**

**Conclusion**: **Alpha** is a **dominant strategy** since it always gives a higher payoff than Beta.

---

## Key Insights

* A **dominant strategy** is one that is best across all possible actions by others.
* **Players with dominant strategies will choose them**, but:

  * That doesn't guarantee the overall outcome is **efficient or optimal for the group**.
  * We’ll explore this efficiency vs. individual rationality tension in future videos.



# 🎓 Game Theory: Prisoners' Dilemma & Dominant Strategy – Study Guide

---

## 🧠 What Is the Prisoners' Dilemma?

The **Prisoners' Dilemma** is a foundational concept in game theory where **rational self-interest** leads individuals to a worse collective outcome, even though mutual cooperation would be better for all.

* **Structure**: Each player has a **dominant strategy** to defect (or not cooperate), which is **individually rational**.
* **Problem**: When **all players follow this logic**, the **group ends up worse off** than if they had all cooperated.

🔗 [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)

---

## 🎲 Real-Life Examples Discussed

### 1. **Voluntary Contribution Game**

* **Setup**: 5 players (A–E), each with ₹10
* **Choices**: Contribute any portion (0–10) to a shared pool
* **Mechanism**: Pool is **doubled** and equally redistributed

#### Dominant Strategy Outcome:

* Each player contributes **nothing** (dominant strategy)
* Each keeps ₹10 → Total = ₹50 (across all)

#### Socially Optimal Outcome:

* Everyone contributes ₹10
* Pool = ₹50 → Doubled = ₹100 → Each gets ₹20

🎯 **Conclusion**: Dominant strategy leads to a **Pareto-inefficient** outcome. Cooperation would yield a **higher collective return**.

---

### 2. **Grading Game**

* **Players**: 2
* **Choices**: Alpha or Beta
* **Payoffs**:

  * Alpha–Alpha → B- (2 points each)
  * Beta–Beta → B+ (3 points each)
  * Alpha–Beta → A (4), C (1)

#### Problem:

* **Alpha** is dominant
* Both choose Alpha → Worse off than if both had chosen Beta

---

## 🌍 Global Implication: Climate Change

**The Climate Problem** as a **Prisoners' Dilemma**:

* **Analogy**: Voluntary contribution to climate action
* If **everyone pollutes**, we all lose.
* If **one country acts alone**, the global benefit is small.
* **Free-riding** becomes dominant strategy, but leads to global inefficiency.

🔗 [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

* **Dominant strategies** do not always lead to **desirable group outcomes**.
* The **Prisoners' Dilemma** highlights the tension between **individual rationality** and **collective efficiency**.
* This paradox is central to **policy**, **business strategy**, and **ethics** in decision-making.

---

## 🔮 Next Topic Teaser

> *What happens when **emotions** enter the strategic decision-making process?*

We'll explore whether players still follow dominant strategies when **non-monetary** factors like **fairness**, **reputation**, or **empathy** come into play.

## 📚 Concept Overview

The **Tragedy of the Commons** refers to a situation where **individuals, acting in their own self-interest**, **overuse and deplete shared resources**, leading to **long-term collective loss**.

---

## 🧠 Key Points

* **Commons**: Any **shared, finite resource** (e.g., pastures, air, water, fisheries).
* **Problem**: Each individual benefits from exploiting the resource but **bears only a fraction of the cost**.
* **Result**: **Overconsumption**, degradation, or collapse of the resource.
* **Example**: Overgrazing cattle on a shared field.

---

## 🌎 Modern Implications

* **Environmental degradation**
* **Climate change**
* **Overfishing**
* **Traffic congestion**
* **Data privacy concerns**

---

## 🛠️ Potential Solutions

* **Regulation** (government policies)
* **Privatization**
* **Collective agreements**
* **Technological innovation**

# 🎓 Emotions & Cooperation in Game Theory

---

## Why Emotions Matter

In real-world settings—unlike pure theoretical models—**emotions, relationships, and social bonds** significantly influence choices in strategic games, often leading to more cooperative outcomes.

---

## 👫 Example: Grading Game With Loved Ones

* **Scenario**: You play the Alpha/Beta grading game with close family (e.g., spouse or child).
* **Rational Analysis**: Alpha is still the **dominant strategy** for everyone.
* **Emotional Influence**:

  * With a spouse: You think of the shared outcome—**joint optimization**—and choose Beta.
  * With a child: You may choose Beta to maximize **their happiness**, even at your own expense.
  * With a threat (e.g., facing someone stronger): You might choose Beta to avoid confrontation—even if it's irrationally “optimal.”

---

## 💔 Real-World Classroom Experiments

* In practice, most students still choose Alpha—but a significant **minority choose Beta**, often citing:

  > *“I want to give cooperation a chance.”*

* Among **military cadets**, nearly everyone opts for Beta, reasoning that their partner’s well-being (or mission cohesion) outweighs personal gain.

---

## 🌱 Voluntary Contribution Game: Altruism in Action

* Theoretical dominant strategy: **Contribute nothing.**
* Experimental reality: On average, contributions of **3–4 rupees** are observed.
* This suggests a **willingness to cooperate**, even when the dominant strategy predicts otherwise.

---

## 🛠️ Implications for Management

* **Bringing Alpha‑players to Beta** often hinges on fostering:

  * **Trust**
  * **Team spirit**
  * **Shared identity or values**
* Management strategies must **leverage social bonds and emotional incentives**, not just rational analysis.

---

## 🔭 What’s Next

In upcoming sections, we’ll explore:

* More **corporate examples** of the Prisoners’ Dilemma
* How **self-interest**, emotion, and strategic foresight interact in complex real-world situations

[What is the Tragedy of the Commons? (TED‑Ed)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxC161GvMPc&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## 🌐 Tragedy of the Commons – Key Takeaways

* **Commons** are shared resources (e.g., fisheries, atmosphere, public lands).
* Individuals acting in self-interest can **deplete or degrade** these resources, harming everyone, even though **cooperation would benefit all**. ([en.wikipedia.org][1])
* Solutions include **regulation, privatization**, or **collective management**, as outlined by economists like Garrett Hardin and Elinor Ostrom. ([en.wikipedia.org][1])

---

## 🎯 Real-World Prisoners’ Dilemma in Action

### 1. **Tobacco Advertising Ban (U.S., 1971)**

* Two major tobacco companies face a typical **Prisoners’ Dilemma**: individually, each wants to advertise to gain market share; jointly, not advertising would **eliminate mutual waste** on promotional expenses.
* When the government banned cigarette advertising, **advertising budgets dropped**, **profits increased**, and **stock prices rose**—despite concerns that the ban would be harmful. ([red-files-public.s3.amazonaws.com][2], [reference.findlaw.com][3])
* With no ability to differentiate brands via ads, firms retained about **50% market share each**, cut costs, and **blocked new entrants**, increasing profitability.

---

### 2. **International Nuclear Arms Race**

* Countries face a Prisoners’ Dilemma: **not having nuclear weapons** weakens security, so **everyone builds them**.
* While mutual disarmament would be optimal, a rational, dominant strategy (having bombs) leads to an **arms buildup**—even if it reduces global safety.

---

### 3. **Pharmaceutical Advertising: Patented vs. Generics**

* **In the U.S.**, doctors prescribe drugs by **generic name**, enabling pharmacists to substitute generics. Hence, advertising boosts the entire category—not a single company—reducing its ROI.
* **In India**, doctors write brand names (often for generics). This makes **brand-specific advertising effective**, leading companies to promote generics too.&#x20;
* This difference highlights how **market rules shape firms’ dominant strategies** in a Prisoners’ Dilemma framework.

---

## 🔍 Discussion Points

1. **Dominant strategies** (advertise, arm, brand market) may make sense individually—but lead to **suboptimal collective outcomes**.
2. **Policy interventions**—like the advertising ban or non-proliferation treaties—shift payoffs, aligning private incentives with **improved social welfare**.
3. **Market context** (e.g., generic prescribing laws) can overturn or reinforce strategic incentives.

---

## 🧭 Takeaway Lesson

* Dominant strategies don’t guarantee the best collective outcomes.
* Understanding strategic dynamics allows policymakers and managers to **re-engineer payoffs**—through laws, norms, or market structures—to shift behavior from **competitive** to **cooperative**.
* Whether in advertising, arms control, or environment, **strategic insight drives effective interventions**.

# 📘 Essential Reading: *Crocin or Paracetamol: What Should the Doctor Prescribe?*

**Source**: Mostly Economics (via *Economic & Political Weekly*, October 2013)
**Authors**: Chirantan Chatterjee, Kensuke Kubo, Viswanath Pingali
**[Read the full article](https://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/crocin-or-paracetamol-what-should-the-doctor-prescribe/)**

---

## 🔍 Overview

This article examines the potential regulatory shift in India—from doctors prescribing brand names (e.g., Crocin, Dolo) to prescribing by the **generic molecule name** (e.g., paracetamol). It discusses the potential **benefits** for consumers and **concerns** about quality and market dynamics.

---

## ✅ Advantages of Generic-Prescribing

1. **Lower Prices** – Generic prescriptions could reduce costs, making medicines more affordable.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

2. **Increased Competition** – Ensuring all brands share the market more fairly, potentially lowering costs further.


---

## ⚠️ Risks & Concerns

1. **Quality Variation** – Without strict enforcement of WHO’s Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), cheaper generics might be of lower quality.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

2. **Pharmacist Incentives** – Pharmacists might substitute costlier generics offering higher margins rather than the cheapest or best-quality option.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

3. **Strategic Branding Behaviors** – To stand out, manufacturers may launch branded combinations, which may not always align with clinical best practices.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

4. **Complex Drugs (Biologics)** – For drugs like insulin, proving bioequivalence is technically challenging, complicating substitution decisions.
   ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

---

## 🏥 Policy Implications

* **Regulatory Rigour Needed** – To ensure generic prescriptions work, regulators must enforce consistent quality standards across manufacturers.
  ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

* **Awareness for Patients and Doctors** – Education around generic efficacy is key to counter brand-based perceptions.
  ([mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com][1])

---

## 📌 Relevance to Game Theory

This example reflects a **strategic dilemma** for pharmaceutical players akin to a **Prisoners’ Dilemma**:

* **Brands**: Prefer doctors prescribing generics only if they **can still differentiate** via marketing.
* **Regulation**: Mandating generic names removes differentiation, forcing brands to **compete on quality and cost**.
* **Outcome**: Consumer welfare improves only if **regulation is enforced**, and quality safeguards are maintained.

---

## 🌸 Context & Health Risks

* **Perfumes and cosmetics** often contain complex chemicals—some undisclosed—that can trigger health issues like **allergic reactions**, **asthma**, **dermatitis**, or even **anxiety** in nearly 10% of individuals.&#x20;
* Despite these risks, perfume use is increasing—many wearers are **unwilling to give it up**.

---

## 🔄 The Prisoners’ Dilemma of Beauty

### Scenario:

* If **no one wears perfume**, a woman could gain **no health risk** and maintain her **natural attractiveness**.
* If **others wear perfume**, **beauty standards shift**, making them seem more attractive—even if health risks increase.
* Thus, with **rational self-interest**, individuals wear perfume to “keep up”—despite collective health costs.

### Outcome:

* **Mutual perfume use** becomes the norm.
* Winning attractiveness at the cost of health leads people into a **vicious cycle**.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

* **Individual choice** to wear perfume may seem rational, but collectively it leads to **increased health risks**—a classic Prisoners’ Dilemma.
* Reflects how **social norms** and **indirect pressures** heavily influence private decisions.
* The dilemma persists even when recognizing the risks—because no one wants to be at a perceived disadvantage in attractiveness.

---

## 🧠 Relevance for Game Theory

* Demonstrates how **non-economic factors** (health, beauty norms) drive socially suboptimal equilibrium.
* Shows a game where **dominant strategies** lead to **collective harm**, not just lost efficiency.
* Suggests that intervention (education, regulation, or social change) may be needed to **reset perceptions and standards**.

# 📘 Recommended Reading: *Finessing the Political System—The Cigarette Advertising Ban*

**Authors**: Mitchell, M. L., & Mulherin, J. H.
**Published in**: *Southern Economic Journal*, Vol. 54, No. 4 (Apr. 1988), pp. 855–862
\**[Access Article on JSTOR →](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1059521?seq=3)*

---

## 📌 Summary

This study investigates the **economic impact** of the 1970 ban on cigarette advertising on **major tobacco firms** in the United States. Contrary to expectations that restrictions would harm these firms, the authors find that such regulation actually **boosted profitability and reduced risk** for incumbent players.

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

* **Positive Stock Market Reaction**:
  Using event study methodology, the researchers observed **positive abnormal stock returns** for tobacco firms following the announcement of the advertising ban.

* **Risk Reduction**:
  There was a **significant decline in systematic risk (beta)** for major tobacco companies, indicating a more stable financial outlook post-ban.

* **Less Brand Competition**:
  Since the ban applied to all companies, it **froze brand recognition levels**, limiting the ability of new entrants or smaller brands to compete effectively.

* **Barrier to Entry**:
  The ban created **high entry barriers**, protecting established firms by preventing newcomers from using advertising to build market share.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

* **Prisoner's Dilemma Analogy**:
  Firms were stuck in an advertising arms race. The government-imposed ban effectively **coordinated a “no-advertise” equilibrium**, improving collective industry profitability.

* **Game Theory Lens**:
  The ban enforced cooperation in a non-cooperative industry setting, acting like an **external mechanism to escape a suboptimal dominant strategy outcome**.

* **Policy Insight**:
  Well-targeted regulation can **realign incentives** and lead to more **economically stable industry outcomes**, even for the regulated entities themselves.

## 🔍 Relevance to Game Theory & Strategy

This article is an excellent case study in:

* **Strategic interactions under regulation**
* **Market equilibrium shifts due to policy**
* **The benefits of enforced coordination in Prisoner’s Dilemma-like settings**
* **Stock market as a feedback mechanism for strategic policy changes**

## 📚 Chapter 3: Strategic Moves

Chapter 3 focuses on **strategic moves**—actions a player takes to **influence the future choices** of other players in a game by **altering the game's structure**.

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

* **Commitments**:
  These are irreversible moves that shape others' responses. For example, a firm investing in a costly factory signals commitment to a market.

* **Threats and Promises**:

  * A **threat** is a conditional move: "If you do X, I will do Y to harm you."
  * A **promise** is the opposite: "If you do X, I will reward you with Y."
    Both must be **credible** to influence others’ decisions.

* **Credibility**:
  A strategic move is only effective if **believable**. The authors explain how **reputation, prior actions, contracts, or third-party enforcement** can help establish credibility.

* **Game Examples**:

  * Entry deterrence in markets (e.g., pricing strategies to keep competitors out)
  * Deterrence strategies in military and diplomacy
  * Bargaining situations, like salary negotiations or deal-making

---

## 💡 Practical Applications

* In business, **credible commitments** (like patents, long-term contracts) can discourage competitors.
* In diplomacy, **mutually assured destruction (MAD)** is used as a credible threat to deter aggression.
* In everyday life, even parenting or team sports use strategies of promises and threats to steer behavior.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Thinking Takeaway

Chapter 3 emphasizes that **structure and foresight matter**:

* Think ahead about how others will react.
* Change the game by committing credibly.
* Use threats and promises to align incentives.

# 🎯 Game Theory: Dominant Strategy ≠ Prisoner's Dilemma

## 📌 Key Distinction

* **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that yields a better (or equal) outcome for a player, no matter what the others do.
* **Prisoner's Dilemma**: A specific application of dominant strategy where individual rational choices lead to a worse collective outcome.

---

## 🧾 Case Study: Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction (Vickrey Auction)

### 🔍 Auction Mechanics

* **Setup**: Each participant submits a sealed bid.
* **Winner**: Highest bidder.
* **Price Paid**: Second-highest bid (not their own).

This format encourages **truthful bidding**: bid = your valuation (B = V).

### 📈 Why B = V Is a Dominant Strategy

1. **Overbidding (B > V)**:

   * You may win but pay more than the item’s value → **negative payoff**.
   * **Worse** than bidding your true valuation.

2. **Underbidding (B < V)**:

   * You risk **losing the item**, even when your value exceeds the second-highest bid.
   * The potential loss in utility outweighs the gain from paying less.
   * \[Exercise suggested: prove this yourself.]

Thus, bidding your **true value** is always safe or better—making it a **dominant strategy**.

---

## ⚠️ Behavioral Insight: Rational Theory vs. Practice

* **Theory**: B = V is optimal (as proven by [William Vickrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vickrey), Nobel Laureate).
* **Practice**: People tend to **overbid** due to:

  * Exuberance about paying less than bid.
  * **Distrust** in others’ rationality.
  * Misconception that overbidding increases winning chances without downside.

# 🧠 What If There Is No Dominant Strategy?

## 🎯 Key Idea

If **no dominant strategy** exists, use the **iterated elimination of dominated strategies (IEDS)** to simplify the game and make rational decisions.

---

## 🧪 Classroom Game: Median Guessing Game

### 👇 Setup

* Announced prize: ₹100
* Each student chooses an integer between **0–100**.
* **Median** of all submitted numbers is computed, then **divided by 2** and **rounded down**.
* The **winner** is the player whose number is closest to (but **not exceeding**) the final value.

### 🎯 Objective

Maximize the chance of being closest to the derived number (median ÷ 2, rounded down).

---

## 🔁 Strategy: Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies

### 1️⃣ **Round 1**:

* Numbers **51–100** are **dominated**: even if everyone plays 100, the median is 100 → result = 50.
* Thus, these numbers can never win.

### 2️⃣ **Round 2**:

* Assume all players have eliminated 51–100.
* Now, median can at most be 50 → result = 25.
* So **26–50** are now also dominated.

### 🔁 Continue Iteration:

* Repeat this process:

  * Eliminate **dominated** numbers each round.
  * Eventually, **only 0** remains as a rational strategy under **full common knowledge** and **perfect rationality**.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Insight: Level-K Thinking

Despite theoretical elimination leading to **0**:

* **Actual winners** in the class are typically those who pick **18–20**.
* Why? Players anticipate **limited rationality** in others.
* They reason: "Others might not go all the way to 0, so I’ll stop at level-2 or level-3 reasoning."

This is called **[Level-K reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level-K_theory)**:

* **Level-0**: Random behavior or default.
* **Level-1**: Best response to Level-0.
* **Level-2**: Best response to Level-1.
* ... and so on.

# 🗳️ Median Voter Theorem and Iterated Elimination

## 📌 Concept Overview

The **Median Voter Theorem**, attributed to economist [Harold Hotelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law), explains why in a **two-candidate election**, both candidates tend to converge their positions toward the **median voter's** preferences.

---

## 🧠 Assumptions and Setup

* **Two candidates** competing for votes on a single **polarizing issue**.
* Issue positions range from **1 (extreme left)** to **10 (extreme right)**.
* **Voters are uniformly distributed** (10% per position).
* Each voter votes for the **closest candidate** in terms of ideological position.
* **Each candidate wants to maximize vote share** (not just win).

---

## 🔄 Strategic Logic: Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies

1. **Extreme positions are eliminated first**:

   * Position **2** is always better than **1**.
   * Position **9** is always better than **10**.
   * ⇒ **Eliminate 1 and 10**.

2. Repeat the logic:

   * Now, **3** is better than **2**, and **8** is better than **9**.
   * ⇒ **Eliminate 2 and 9**.

3. Continue iteratively:

   * Eventually, only **positions 5 and 6** remain as **undominated**.

---

## 🧭 Result: Candidate Convergence to the Center

* Both candidates will **strategically choose position 5 or 6** to capture the **median voter**.
* **Why?** Because moving away from the median reduces vote share under rational assumptions.

---

## ⚠️ Important Caveats

* The theorem assumes:

  * **Two players only** – It doesn't hold with more than two candidates.
  * **Single-issue** decision space – Multi-issue models are more complex.
  * **Uniform voter distribution** – In real life, voter ideology may be skewed.

* In more complex (e.g., grid or spatial) settings, **Euclidean distance functions** might be used instead of simple linear ones.

# Essential Reading: Median Voter Theorem

**Source:**
[Quickonomics – *Median Voter Theorem Definition & Examples* (January 6, 2023)](https://quickonomics.com/terms/median-voter-theorem/)

## Overview

The [**Median Voter Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem) is a fundamental concept in both political science and economics. It posits that in a democratic election within a multi-party system, the party or candidate whose position is closest to the preferences of the **median voter** is most likely to win.

## Key Points

* In a **two-party system**, political parties tend to gravitate toward the center of the political spectrum to capture the median voter.
* This behavior explains the adoption or rejection of specific policies based on their appeal to the middle-ground voter base.
* The theorem helps interpret political strategy and policy-making decisions, particularly in democracies with majority voting systems.

## Implications

* Encourages **policy moderation**, as extreme positions may alienate the median voter.
* Influences campaign strategies, particularly in **first-past-the-post electoral systems**.
* Provides a framework for analyzing **electoral outcomes** and the stability of **democratic institutions**.

## Overview

[**K-level Thinking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level-k_theory) (also known as Level-K reasoning) is a framework used in game theory and logic puzzles. It involves scenarios in which all participants are assumed to be perfectly rational and possess **infinite intelligence**, allowing them to make flawless deductions and assume the same of others.

## Key Concepts

* **Perfect Rationality**: Each player is capable of flawless reasoning.
* **Common Knowledge**: It is assumed that all players know the rules, know that others know the rules, and so on.
* **Recursive Reasoning**: Players reason about what others are thinking, potentially through many layers (e.g., "I think that you think that I think...").

## Applications

* Used to analyze and predict outcomes in [**Nash Equilibria**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium).
* Helps model behavior in strategic games where anticipating others’ reasoning levels is crucial.
* Applied in fields like [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), economics, and psychology.

[Read on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117865)

## Overview

[**The Traveler’s Dilemma**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_dilemma) is a one-shot game developed by economist **Kaushik Basu** to illustrate the limitations and paradoxes of traditional [game-theoretic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), especially those based on **backward induction**.

## Key Concepts

* **Backward Induction**: A method of reasoning backwards from the end of a problem or game to determine optimal strategies. Though logically sound, it can lead to unintuitive outcomes.
* **Paradoxes of Rationality**: The game showcases how strictly rational behavior, as defined in classical game theory, can lead to decisions that conflict with human intuition.
* **Comparison with Other Games**:

  * **[Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)**: Highlights issues in cooperative decision-making.
  * **[Centipede Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_game)**: Illustrates failures in backward induction due to the allure of continued cooperation.

## Implications

* Challenges the assumption that players always behave in fully rational ways.
* Suggests that real-world decision-making may require a blend of intuition and formal models.
* Highlights the importance of understanding **bounded rationality** in economic and strategic contexts.

# Summary: Decision-Making in Game Theory

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **Dominant Strategy**

* **Rule 1**: *If there is a dominant strategy, play the dominant strategy.*
* A [**dominant strategy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_strategy) yields a better payoff regardless of the opponent’s choice.
* Example games discussed: **Prisoner’s Dilemma**, **Second-price auction**.

### 2. **Elimination of Dominated Strategies**

* **Rule 2**: *If no dominant strategy exists, eliminate dominated strategies.*
* Use **[iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_elimination_of_strictly_dominated_strategies)** to narrow down the strategy set.

### 3. **Median Voter Theorem**

* Introduced via **Hotelling’s model**, extended to market competition.
* Suggests **minimal product differentiation** as firms, like political parties, converge toward the median consumer or voter.
* Learn more: [Median Voter Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem) and [Hotelling’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law)

### 4. **What if No Dominant or Dominated Strategies?**

* Turn to **Nash Equilibrium**.

## Introduction to Nash Equilibrium

### Pop Culture Reference

* Movie: *[A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_%28film%29)* starring Russell Crowe.
* Based on the life of **John Nash**, the mathematician who formalized the concept of **[Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium)**.

### Definition

* A **Nash Equilibrium** is a set of strategies where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming the other player's strategy remains fixed.
* It is a state of mutual best responses.

### Explanation via Two Players

* **Red man** (Player 1) and **Blue man** (Player 2) each choose a strategy.
* If neither wants to change their strategy when the other's choice is held constant, the system is in equilibrium.

## Transition to Best Response Concept

* The next lesson will cover the concept of **Best Response**:

  * A player’s optimal strategy given the other player's choice.
  * Foundation for visualizing and identifying Nash equilibria in simultaneous-move games.

* Introduced the concept of **[Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium)**.
* Defined a game with two players: **Red Man (Player 1)** and **Blue Man (Player 2)**.

  * **Player 1 (Red Man)** strategies: A, B, C
  * **Player 2 (Blue Man)** strategies: X, Y, Z
* Payoffs were presented for each strategy combination.

---

## What is a Best Response?

A **[best response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_response)** is the strategy that maximizes a player’s payoff, given the strategy of the other player.

### Player 1’s Best Response

| Player 2's Strategy | Player 1's Best Response | Payoffs (A, B, C) |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| X                   | A                        | 9, 5, 7           |
| Y                   | B                        | 5, 11, 9          |
| Z                   | B                        | 21, 25, 19        |

### Player 2’s Best Response

| Player 1's Strategy | Player 2's Best Response | Payoffs (X, Y, Z) |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| A                   | Y                        | 3, 7, 5           |
| B                   | Y                        | 5, 9, 6           |
| C                   | X                        | 8, 7, 6           |

---

## Visualizing Nash Equilibrium

A **Nash Equilibrium** occurs when both players are playing their best responses to each other’s strategies.

### How It Works

* **Player 1's best response** to Player 2’s strategy.
* **Player 2's best response** to Player 1’s strategy.
* If both align — that strategy pair is a **Nash Equilibrium**.

### In This Game

* Best response intersection: **Player 1 plays B**, **Player 2 plays Y**.
* Payoffs: **Player 1 = 11**, **Player 2 = 9**.
* Neither player wants to deviate unilaterally — this is the **Nash Equilibrium**.

---

## Summary

> **Nash Equilibrium**: A strategy profile where each player's strategy is a best response to the other’s.

> In this example, the equilibrium is:
> **Red Man (Player 1): B**
> **Blue Man (Player 2): Y**
> **Payoffs: (11, 9)**

---

# Exploring Versions of Nash Equilibrium

## Recap: Nash Equilibrium Basics

* **Nash Equilibrium**: A situation where each player chooses their **best response** to the other’s strategy, and no player has an incentive to deviate unilaterally.
* Previously illustrated using strategies of **Red Man (Player 1)** and **Blue Man (Player 2)**.

---

## Issues with Nash Equilibrium

### 1. **How is Nash Equilibrium Reached?**

* **John Nash** does not explain how players arrive at equilibrium.
* Equilibrium can occur **by chance** — players independently make choices that align.

### 2. **Is Nash Equilibrium Always Unique?**

* Not necessarily. There may be **multiple Nash equilibria**.
* Raises the question: **Which equilibrium is likely or relevant?**

---

## Example: The *Stag Hunt* Game

**[Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)** is a classic game illustrating coordination and payoff trade-offs.

### Scenario

Two players (Red and Blue) agree to go hunting but forget to coordinate on a meeting place. They have two choices:

* **Stag** (requires both to cooperate, high reward: 4)
* **Rabbit** (can hunt alone, lower reward: 1)

### Payoff Matrix

|                 | Blue: Stag | Blue: Rabbit |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| **Red: Stag**   | 4, 4       | 0, 1         |
| **Red: Rabbit** | 1, 0       | 1, 1         |

### Nash Equilibria

* **(Stag, Stag)**: Best response for both → **Superior Equilibrium**
* **(Rabbit, Rabbit)**: Also best response for both → **Inferior Equilibrium**

---

## Insights from the Stag Hunt

* Even when both players **know** (Stag, Stag) is better, **(Rabbit, Rabbit)** may occur due to:

  * **Risk aversion**
  * **Lack of trust or coordination**
  * **Asymmetric information** (e.g., Red Man’s dietary needs)

### External Information and Focal Points

* The choice of equilibrium can depend on **external signals** or **beliefs** about the other player.
* These are known as **[focal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_%28game_theory%29)** — cues that help players coordinate without communication.

---

## Conclusion

> A **bad outcome** in game theory doesn't necessarily stem from a lack of skill or intelligence — it may be the result of settling into an **inferior equilibrium** due to external conditions or coordination challenges.

---

# Game Theory: Focal Points, Stag Hunt, and the Battle of the Sexes

## Recap: Stag Hunt and Focal Points

### Multiplicity in Nash Equilibria

* The **[Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)** game illustrated two equilibria:

  * **Stag, Stag**: Superior equilibrium (4,4)
  * **Rabbit, Rabbit**: Inferior equilibrium (1,1)

### Key Insights

* **Focal Points**: External information or context that guide players toward one equilibrium over another.

  * Example: Red Man is diabetic and must eat → Rabbit, Rabbit is chosen.
  * Conversely, Red Man is known to be adventurous → Blue Man expects Stag → **Stag, Stag** emerges.

* **Game Theory’s Essence**: It’s not just about one’s own choices, but about **thinking through what others believe you believe**—recursive reasoning.

### Takeaways

* **Equilibrium ≠ Efficiency**: Stag Hunt demonstrates that even a stable outcome can be suboptimal.
* **External context** matters in determining which equilibrium is played.

---

## New Game: The *Battle of the Sexes*

### Scenario Setup

This coordination game involves a stereotypical couple:

* **Man (Red)** prefers **Cricket**
* **Woman (Blue)** prefers **Opera**
* Both prefer to be together rather than apart.

### Payoff Matrix

|                  | Woman: Cricket | Woman: Opera |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **Man: Cricket** | 3, 1           | 0, 0         |
| **Man: Opera**   | 0, 0           | 1, 3         |

### Nash Equilibria

* **Cricket, Cricket** → (3, 1) → Preferred by the man
* **Opera, Opera** → (1, 3) → Preferred by the woman

### Key Insights

* **Equilibrium with Unequal Benefits**: Unlike Stag Hunt where both players had equal payoffs, this game presents **[asymmetric payoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_sexes_%28game_theory%29)**.
* Reflects **inequality within equilibrium**: One player benefits more depending on which equilibrium is selected.

### Broader Implications

* **Inequality as an Equilibrium Outcome**: Differences in outcomes aren't always due to skill or power—they can result purely from which equilibrium the players coordinate on.
* **Equilibrium ≠ Equality**: Reinforces that game-theoretic stability doesn't imply fairness or equity.

### Humorous Note

* If it's someone's birthday, societal or relational context (a focal point) often dictates which equilibrium prevails.

## Summary

| Game                    | Equilibrium Type          | Efficiency    | Equality |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| **Prisoner's Dilemma**  | Bad but stable            | ✘             | ✔        |

# Game Theory: Hawk-Dove Game and Variations in Equilibrium

## Recap of Previous Equilibrium Types

### 1. **Stag Hunt**

* **Equilibria**: Same strategies, **ranked by efficiency**.

  * *Stag, Stag* → superior
  * *Rabbit, Rabbit* → inferior
* Equilibrium can be driven by **risk aversion** and **focal points**.
* Players coordinate on identical actions.

### 2. **Battle of the Sexes**

* **Equilibria**: Same strategies, **unequal payoffs**.

  * *Cricket, Cricket* preferred by one player
  * *Opera, Opera* preferred by the other
* Equilibrium reflects **inequality**, not inefficiency.

---

## 3. **Hawk-Dove Game** *(aka Game of Chicken)*

### Scenario

* Two players (Red and Blue) are racing toward an intersection in cars.
* Strategies:

  * **Hawk** = Don’t yield (keep driving)
  * **Dove** = Yield (brake)

### Payoffs

* If **both play Hawk** → **Crash** → worst outcome for both.
* If **one plays Hawk**, the other Dove → Hawk gets bragging rights, Dove avoids crash.
* If **both play Dove** → safe but no dominance.

### Payoff Matrix (simplified)

|               | Blue: Hawk | Blue: Dove |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Red: Hawk** | -10, -10   | 10, 0      |
| **Red: Dove** | 0, 10      | 1, 1       |

### Nash Equilibria

* **(Hawk, Dove)** and **(Dove, Hawk)**: Both are **pure-strategy Nash equilibria**.

  * Each player's best response depends on the other's choice.
* **Mixed Strategy Equilibrium**: Players randomize between Hawk and Dove.

### Key Insights

* Unlike previous games, **players choose different strategies** in equilibrium.
* Reflects **asymmetry in behavior**, yet still achieves stability.

---

## Comparing the Three Equilibrium Types

| Game                    | Strategy Type | Equilibria Rank | Equality | Strategy Match |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| **Stag Hunt**           | Identical     | Ranked          | Yes      | Same           |
| **Battle of the Sexes** | Identical     | Not Ranked      | No       | Same           |
| **Hawk-Dove / Chicken** | Different     | Not Ranked      | No       | Different      |

---

## Conclusion

* Game theory explores various **notions of equilibrium**, each revealing different dimensions:

  * **Efficiency** (Stag Hunt)
  * **Equity** (Battle of the Sexes)
  * **Strategic Asymmetry** (Hawk-Dove)
* Understanding these distinctions is crucial for applying game theory in real-world situations like negotiation, conflict resolution, and competition.

# Essential Reading: Climate Change and Nash Equilibrium

**Source:**
[INOMICS – *Stag Hunt* (July 13, 2023)](https://inomics.com/terms/stag-hunt-1537413#:~:text=A%20stag%20hunt%20dilemma%20results,may%20defect%20and%20hunt%20rabbits)

## Overview

The **[Stag Hunt dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)**, originally introduced by philosopher **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**, models a conflict between individual risk aversion and collective reward.

In this context, it serves as a powerful metaphor for **[climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change)** cooperation efforts, where:

* **Collective action** (e.g., international agreements to reduce emissions) promises high benefits if everyone participates.
* **Defection** (e.g., prioritizing national interests) yields safer, lower payoffs for individuals but undermines global outcomes.

## Key Concepts

* **Social Cooperation vs. Personal Security**: Players (countries) must decide between high-risk cooperation or low-risk defection.
* **Trust and Coordination**: Success depends on mutual expectations and external signals (focal points).
* **Nash Equilibrium**: Can result in suboptimal outcomes (e.g., minimal cooperation), mirroring real-world climate negotiations.

## Implications for Climate Policy

* Effective climate strategies must consider game-theoretic barriers to cooperation.
* **Institutional design**, **credible commitments**, and **shared norms** can help shift equilibrium toward collective action.

# Essential Reading: Coordination Games

**Source:**
Parikh, C. (2008, June 11). *[The Battle of the Sexes and the Stag Hunt](https://capitalideasonline.com/wordpress/the-battle-of-the-sexes-and-the-stag-hunt/)*

## Overview

This article explores **[coordination games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game)** through classic examples like the **[Battle of the Sexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_sexes_%28game_theory%29)** and the **[Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)** to examine how cultural norms, expectations, and strategic reasoning influence decision-making and outcomes.

## Key Concepts

* **Multiple Nash Equilibria**: Coordination games often have more than one equilibrium, some of which may be suboptimal.
* **Cultural and Historical Influences**: Social context and traditions can entrench certain equilibria, making change difficult.
* **Corruption as Equilibrium**: The article illustrates how mutual expectations in corrupt systems can stabilize into a **self-sustaining Nash equilibrium**—both parties (e.g., giver and taker of bribes) expect and act on corrupt behaviors.

## Insights

* Shifting from a **suboptimal** to a **superior equilibrium** requires more than just awareness—it often involves institutional reform or shifts in public expectations.
* Coordination failures are not just theoretical concerns but are reflected in real-world governance and economic interactions.

# Recommended Reading: *The Tower of Babel as a Coordination Game: Political Linguistics in Ghana*

**Source:**
Laitin, D. D. (1994). *[The Tower of Babel as a Coordination Game: Political Linguistics in Ghana](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/tower-of-babel-as-a-coordination-game-political-linguistics-in-ghana/FDB3922197B5C2B847B8D05D8AD61B36)*. *American Political Science Review*, 88(3), 622–634.

## Overview

This article models the linguistic dilemma in multilingual states like **Ghana** as a **coordination problem** using a framework known as an **n-person tipping game**. It addresses the difficulties of shifting from a suboptimal but stable **English-only equilibrium** to a more culturally inclusive **indigenous language equilibrium**.

## Key Concepts

* **Coordination Game**: Choosing a common language is a coordination challenge where individuals benefit most when they align with others’ choices.
* **Tipping Point Dynamics**: A critical mass adopting an indigenous language could shift the equilibrium, but reaching this point is challenging.
* **Empirical Basis**: Uses field data from Ghana to support theoretical claims.

## Core Argument

* While there is broad recognition of the **cultural limitations** of an English-only system, the absence of a **viable coordination mechanism** inhibits the adoption of indigenous languages as official.
* Laitin proposes mechanisms for overcoming these barriers, highlighting the importance of state support, symbolic incentives, and educational reform.

## Relevance

* Applies game theory to **linguistic politics**, making it a foundational work in the intersection of **political science**, **sociolinguistics**, and **game theory**.

Bass, W. (2023, May 20). *[Book review: ‘Why Nations Fail,’ by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-why-nations-fail-by-daron-acemoglu-and-james-a-robinson/2012/04/20/gIQAcHs8VT_story.html)*. *The Washington Post*

## Overview

This review of *[Why Nations Fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail)* summarizes the central thesis of **Daron Acemoglu** and **James A. Robinson**: that the **quality of institutions**—not geography, culture, or resources—is the primary determinant of a nation's economic success or failure.

## Key Concepts

* **Inclusive Institutions**: Promote power-sharing, property rights, innovation, and broad-based economic prosperity.
* **Extractive Institutions**: Centralize power and wealth among elites, stifling growth and perpetuating poverty.

## Case Studies

* **Botswana**: Cited as a success story due to its inclusive political and economic institutions.
* **Congo and Zimbabwe**: Examples of extractive institutions leading to stagnation and failure.

## Relevance

* Offers a **political economy** framework to explain long-term development outcomes.
* Challenges deterministic theories based on geography or culture, reinforcing the importance of institutional design.

# Application Focus: Stag Hunt and Economic Development

## Recap: Stag Hunt Game

* The **[Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)** is a game that models the tension between **mutual cooperation** (leading to higher payoff) and **individual risk aversion** (leading to lower but safer payoff).
* Central theme: **Coordination failure** can lead to suboptimal but stable equilibria.

---

## Case Study: Industrial Revolution as a Stag Hunt

### Source Inspirations:

* *[Why Nations Fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail)* by **Daron Acemoglu** and **James A. Robinson**
* Wydick, B. – Coordination traps and development

### Scenario

* **Three players**: Railways, Coal, and Steel industries
* **Investment Game**:

  * If **all invest ₹100**, each gets a **return of ₹150** → profit of ₹50
  * If **even one doesn’t invest**, others get **zero return**

### Game Structure

* 2D matrix representation with a third player’s strategy captured through separate panels.
* **Two Nash Equilibria**:

  * **All Invest**: (₹50, ₹50, ₹50) → Cooperative, **superior equilibrium**
  * **None Invest**: (₹0, ₹0, ₹0) → Risk-averse, **inferior equilibrium**

---

## Interpretation

### Development as Coordination

* Developed Economy: All key industries coordinate and invest → Prosperity
* Underdeveloped Economy: Lack of coordination → No industrial take-off

### Role of Institutions

* **Legal Infrastructure**: Enables **contract enforcement** and **trust**, supporting coordination.
* Weak institutions → High risk of **coordination failure**

### Broader Relevance

* This model captures the essence of **coordination traps** in **development economics**.
* Illustrates why **institutional quality** (e.g., property rights, law enforcement, ease of doing business) is vital for economic growth.

---

## Key Takeaways

| Feature               | Developed Economy      | Underdeveloped Economy     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Player Actions        | All invest (cooperate) | None invest (defect)       |
| Outcome               | High payoff            | Zero payoff                |
| Nash Equilibrium Type | Efficient, cooperative | Risk-dominant, inferior    |
| Institutional Role    | Enables coordination   | Fails to prevent defection |

# Development, Social Norms, and Direct Network Effects in Coordination Games

## Recap: Coordination and Development

* **Development** is characterized by successful **coordination** among key economic agents.
* **Underdevelopment** reflects **coordination failure**, often due to institutional weakness.
* Targeted investment in **only one sector** (e.g., railways, coal) cannot resolve low-level equilibrium traps.
* Holistic, multi-sectoral strategies are essential for achieving **high-equilibrium outcomes**.

---

## Role of Social Norms in Coordination

### Stag Hunt and Social Norms

* Two equilibria:

  * **Stag-Stag** (cooperation, high reward)
  * **Rabbit-Rabbit** (defection, low reward)
* Example: A **social custom** (e.g., “eat stag on Wednesdays”) serves as a **focal point**, increasing the likelihood of cooperation.
* Insight from **[anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology)**: Social norms **create expectations** that facilitate coordination.

---

## Modern Example: Social Media Platforms

### Coordination Game Analogy

* Platforms: **Orkut**, **Facebook**, **Instagram**
* Utility of joining depends on **others also joining** (not intrinsic features alone).
* **Direct Network Effects**:

  * Utility increases with the number of users.
  * Common in technologies like social media and mobile phones.

### Payoff Examples

| Platform Pair                         | Payoffs |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Orkut–Orkut                           | 10, 10  |
| Facebook–Facebook                     | 30, 30  |
| Instagram–Instagram (slightly better) | 31, 31  |

### Challenge with Incremental Innovation

* Even if Instagram offers a slightly higher payoff, **incremental improvement** may not be enough.
* **Mass migration** required for coordination to shift platforms.
* Without it, **coordination failure** keeps users locked into the current (suboptimal) equilibrium.

---

## Technical Concept: Direct Network Effects

* Defined as: *“The value of a product increases with the number of users”*
* Examples:

  * **Social media**: Posts gain value with more viewers.
  * **Mobile phones**: More users mean broader utility.

## Key Takeaways

| Concept                    | Implication                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coordination failure**   | Explains underdevelopment and failed innovation          |
| **Social norms**           | Act as focal points to guide collective behavior         |
| **Direct network effects** | Require critical mass for innovations to succeed         |
| **Incremental innovation** | Often fails in networked environments without mass shift |

# Network Effects, Mergers, and Multi-Homing in Platform Markets

## Recap: Network Effects and Incremental Innovation

* **Direct Network Effects**: The value of a product increases with the number of its users (e.g., social media platforms).
* **Incremental Innovation**: Often fails unless a **critical mass** migrates to the new product—highlighting the importance of **coordination**.

---

## Strategic Mergers in the Digital Economy

### Examples:

* Acquisitions of **LinkedIn**, **Skype**, **WhatsApp**, and **Instagram**.

### Rationale:

1. **Synergies** with existing services (to be discussed later).
2. **Preemptive acquisition**: Emerging platforms could **disrupt current equilibrium** and replace the incumbent.
3. **Cash-burn strategy**: A startup rapidly grows user base to create **network effects**, prompting acquisition before profitability.

---

## Indirect Network Effects: The Two-Sided Market

### Scenario: App-Based Taxi Services

* **Players**: Passengers and Drivers
* **Platforms**: Uber and Ola (India), Uber and Lyft (US), Grab (Southeast Asia), Didi (China)

### Coordination Game Structure:

| Passenger / Driver | Ola    | Uber   |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Ola**            | 30, 30 | 0, 0   |
| **Uber**           | 0, 0   | 30, 30 |

* **Indirect Network Effects**:

  * More drivers → more passengers
  * More passengers → more drivers

## Market Structures: Single-Homing vs. Multi-Homing

| Concept           | Description                                                 | Example                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Single-Homing** | Only one platform survives in the market                    | Facebook (social media)     |
| **Multi-Homing**  | Multiple platforms coexist, each sustaining its own network | Uber and Ola (ride-hailing) |

* **Stag Hunt Parallel**:

  * Single species of stag → **Single-Homing**
  * Two species of stag → **Multi-Homing**
    (users split between equally good platforms)

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Network effects**—both direct and indirect—are central to understanding platform dynamics.
* **M\&A strategy** in tech often involves eliminating future threats through early acquisition.
* **Multi-homing** supports coexistence of competing platforms, even in coordination-driven markets.
* The **Stag Hunt game** offers a flexible model for capturing these strategic decisions.

# Recommended Reading: *Small Firms and Digital Platforms*

**Source:**
Chadha, N., Pingali, V., & Sokol, D. D. (2023). *[Small Firms and Digital Platforms](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4573570)*. *SSRN Electronic Journal*.

## Overview

This paper explores how **small firms** engage with **digital platforms** for advertising and sales, particularly during early growth and market expansion phases.

## Key Findings

* **Digital Preference**: Small businesses initially prefer digital platforms over conventional media for marketing, especially when **scaling operations** or **exporting**.
* **Media Shift with Growth**:

  * As firms mature, they continue to use digital advertising.
  * However, they **diversify** into traditional media channels (e.g., print, TV) as part of broader strategies.

## Relevance to Platform Economics

* Highlights **[multihoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multihoming)**—firms use multiple platforms (established and emerging) simultaneously.
* Demonstrates the value of **platform choice** in business strategy and competitiveness.

## Policy Implications

* Informs debates on **digital platform regulation**:

  * Supports the need for **competitive platform environments**.
  * Encourages **accessibility and fairness** for smaller market participants.

# Digital Markets, Network Effects, and Antitrust Concerns

## Recap: Network Effects and Stag Hunt Dynamics

* Digital platforms are often modeled as **[Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)** games, where multiple equilibria exist.
* **Network effects**—both **direct** and **indirect**—drive platform success.
* **Scale begets scale**: More users attract more content/providers, reinforcing dominance.

---

## Case Study: Microsoft and Internet Explorer

### Background

* **Two Markets**:

  1. **Operating Systems** (e.g., Windows)
  2. **Web Browsers** (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator)

### Stag Hunt Dynamics

* More users on an OS → more applications developed → more users join → **self-reinforcing equilibrium**.
* More content compatible with a browser → more users adopt that browser → further content develops.

### Legal Case: *Microsoft vs. Netscape Navigator*

* **Issue**: Microsoft bundled **Internet Explorer** with **Windows 95**.
* **Allegation**: This constituted **[abuse of dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_dominant_position)** by extending dominance from one market (OS) to another (browser).

---

## Broader Applications in Digital Antitrust

### Common Examples

* **Google Search and Google Maps**:

  * Is the integration (bundling) of Maps with Search enhancing user experience or suppressing competition?

* **Amazon and White Label Products**:

  * Does Amazon favor its own brands on its platform over third-party sellers?
  * **Marketplace (Amazon)** is the dominant **focal point**—is it unfairly pushing **Amazon-branded goods**?

---

## Key Concerns

* **Leveraging Dominance**:

  * Dominance in one market can potentially be leveraged to gain unfair advantage in another.

* **Antitrust Gray Area**:

  * Difficult to clearly differentiate between:

    * **Innovation** (beneficial bundling/integration)
    * **Abuse of dominance** (strategic exclusion of competitors)

* **Legal Ambiguity**:

  * There's **no definitive test** to draw the line.
  * Regulation must weigh **consumer benefit** vs. **market distortion**.

---

## Implication for M\&A in Digital Markets

* Mergers are often **preemptive**:

  * Established firms acquire **emerging platforms** to eliminate potential future threats.
* But not all **better innovations succeed**—due to **coordination failures**, even superior platforms may fail to gain traction.

---

## Upcoming Topic

> **Can firms design strategies to overcome coordination problems and ensure adoption of better innovations?**

# Strategic Response to Coordination Failure: Innovation and Coopetition

## Recap: Coordination Failure and Innovation

* **New technologies** are often vulnerable to **[Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)** failures.
* Successful innovation requires **system-wide coordination**—not just individual firm effort.
* Failure to coordinate can lead even **superior products** to fail in the market.

---

## Example: Electric Cars and Charging Infrastructure

### Coordination Problem

* **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** need:

  * **Charging stations** to be viable.
  * But stations won’t emerge unless EVs are widely used.
* **Classic coordination loop**:

  * No cars → no stations
  * No stations → no cars

### Historical Context

* Referenced in *[The Art of Strategy](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780393337174/the-art-of-strategy)* by **Barry Nalebuff** and **Avinash Dixit**:

  * In the **early 1900s**, electric cars were a strong contender.
  * **Internal combustion engines** won due to coordination and infrastructure advantages.

---

## Strategic Solution: Coopetition

### What is **Coopetition**?

* A blend of **cooperation and competition**.
* Coined in strategy literature to describe rivals who:

  * **Cooperate** to build shared infrastructure or ecosystems.
  * **Compete** in the product or customer market.

### Application to EV Market

* EV firms (e.g., Tesla, Rivian, Ford) may **jointly invest** in charging infrastructure.
* **Collective action** raises the entire market's viability, from which all benefit.
* This enables transition from a **low-adoption equilibrium** to a **high-adoption equilibrium**.

### Game Theory View

* **Prisoner's Dilemma** in product competition: Firms prefer to outperform rivals.
* **Stag Hunt** in infrastructure coordination: Firms need **mutual commitment** to enable innovation.

---

## Key Takeaways

| Concept                           | Role in Innovation Strategy                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coordination Failure**          | Risk when complementary elements don’t co-develop        |
| **Coopetition**                   | Strategic alliance among competitors for mutual gain     |
| **Infrastructure as Public Good** | Firms may need to collectively invest in shared enablers |
| **Mixed Strategy Environment**    | Compete in one space, cooperate in another               |

# Revisiting the *Battle of the Sexes*: Applications and Implications

## Recap: Battle of the Sexes Game

* A classic **[coordination game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game)** involving two players (e.g., man and woman) who prefer **doing something together** over acting separately, but differ in their **individual preferences**.
* Two **Nash equilibria**:

  * **Sport, Sport** → (4, 1): preferred by the man.
  * **Opera, Opera** → (1, 4): preferred by the woman.

### Key Insight:

* Players want to **coordinate**, but the **outcome benefits one more than the other**.
* **Focal points** (e.g., whose birthday it is) often determine **which equilibrium is selected**.

---

## Inequality Embedded in Equilibrium

* **Important Point**: Inequality in this game is **not accidental** or **off-equilibrium**—it is **built into the equilibrium**.
* Equilibria may be **stable** but also **unfair**.
* This reflects broader societal dynamics:

  * In **patriarchal societies**, the equilibrium favoring men may dominate.
  * **Tyranny of the majority**: Majority preferences set the focal point, pushing out other equilibria.

---

## Broader Implications: Labor-Capital Game

* Players: **Capitalists (owners)** and **Labor (workers)**
* Capital is **scarce** → often becomes the **focal point** in determining equilibrium.
* Result: **Market-determined equilibrium** may favor capital and **institutionalize inequality**.

### Strategic Response: **Collective Bargaining**

* **[Trade unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union)** and **worker associations** emerge to:

  * Shift the focal point.
  * Push the equilibrium toward a **more equitable outcome**.
* Collective action rebalances power in **games with built-in disparities**.

---

## Theoretical Lessons from Equilibrium Analysis

| Game                    | Key Lesson                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Prisoner's Dilemma**  | Efficiency is not guaranteed by equilibrium   |
| **Stag Hunt**           | Even desirable outcomes may not emerge        |
| **Battle of the Sexes** | Inequality can be **inherent** in equilibrium |

### Final Insight:

> **Equilibrium ≠ Goodness**
> Equilibrium describes **stability**, not necessarily **fairness**, **efficiency**, or **justice**.

---

## Relevance to Social and Political Thought

* Helps explain the **need for minority protections**, affirmative action, and policy interventions.
* **Social norms and focal points** shape which equilibria emerge and persist.
* Understanding **equilibrium structure** informs:

  * **Institutional design**
  * **Policy advocacy**
  * **Social justice efforts**
